## 🔍 Weak Areas

1. **Identifying the correct schedule process**  
   - Scenario: “Estimating activity durations and identifying dependencies” in planning.  
   - Correct mapping: these are core steps of **Develop Schedule**, where durations and logic are combined into a schedule model, not just listing or ordering activities.[web:73][web:75][web:76]

2. **Knowing the artifact that traces requirements end-to-end**  
   - Scenario: Stakeholder wants to see how requirements are tracked from origin through design, build, and testing.  
   - Correct artifact: **Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)** – links each requirement to design elements, work items, and test cases for full lifecycle traceability.[web:77][web:79]

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add/strengthen flashcards on:
  - Where **Develop Schedule** fits vs Define/Sequence Activities.  
  - **RTM** purpose and when exam questions point to it (trace from requirement to deliverable/test).  
- Day 15: Another timed block, slightly longer (20–25 questions), with focus on weak spots plus more agile/hybrid scenarios.
