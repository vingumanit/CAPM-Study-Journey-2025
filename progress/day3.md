## 📊 Metrics
| Task | Status | Score/Notes |

| Notes (week1-day3.md) | ✅ Complete | 30min: predictive, agile, hybrid, tailoring |
| Quiz (week1-day3-quiz.md) | ✅ Complete | **8/10** |

## 🔍 Weak Areas

1. **In which life cycle are requirements expected to change frequently?**  
   - Correct: **Agile / Adaptive life cycle**, where requirements evolve based on continuous feedback and change is expected [web:141][web:136].

2. **Delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first and improving each cycle is an example of?**  
   - Correct: **Iterative and/or incremental (Agile) approach**, where an MVP is released early and then refined over multiple cycles [web:141][web:136].

## 📈 Next Steps
- Revisit notes on **agile/adaptive**, **iterative**, and **incremental** life cycles.
- Add/adjust flashcards in `domain1-day3.md` to cover:
  - “Agile/adaptive = high change, frequent feedback”
  - “MVP = iterative/incremental delivery pattern”
- Day 4: Deepen predictive planning basics (scope, schedule, cost).
