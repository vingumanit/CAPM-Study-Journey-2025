## 🔍 Weak Areas
- None for Day 6 (perfect score).  
- Continue to keep an eye on:
  - Clear definition of the **project management plan** as an integrated set of subsidiary plans and baselines.
  - When to choose **predictive** approaches (stable requirements, regulatory/contractual constraints).
  - Formal **change control** when baselines (scope, schedule, cost) are impacted [web:141][web:155].

## 📈 Next Steps
- Day 7: Dive deeper into predictive **scope, schedule, and cost planning processes** (more detail than Week 1).
- Keep daily review of Domain I & Day 6 flashcards to strengthen long-term retention.
