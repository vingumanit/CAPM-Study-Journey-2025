# CAPM Day 4 Progress - Dec 11, 2025 ✅

**Total Study Time**: 4/50 hours (8%)  
**Domain Focus**: PM Fundamentals – Predictive Planning Basics [web:141]

## 📊 Metrics
| Task | Status | Score/Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Notes (week1-day4.md) | ✅ Complete | 30min: scope, WBS, schedule, cost, baselines |
| Quiz (week1-day4-quiz.md) | ✅ Complete | **9/10** |

## 🔍 Weak Areas
- **Scope statement vs schedule**  
  - Scope statement includes: project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, constraints, and exclusions.  
  - It does **not** include detailed activity start/finish dates; those belong to the **project schedule** and **schedule baseline** [web:141][web:155].

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add/adjust flashcards to reinforce:
  - “Scope = what, Schedule = when, Cost = how much.”
  - Scope statement ≠ detailed dates.
- Day 5: Recap Domain I (fundamentals, principles, lifecycles, predictive basics) with a mixed 20–30 question quiz.
- Continue daily review of Domain I flashcards (Days 1–4).
