## 🔍 Key Weak Areas to Revisit

- **Baselines and their primary focus**
  - **Scope baseline** → scope statement, WBS, WBS dictionary (focus = *what work is included*).  
  - **Schedule baseline** → **approved dates and milestones** (focus = *when work happens*).  
  - **Cost baseline** → time‑phased, approved budget used for cost performance measurement (focus = *how much it should cost*) [web:141][web:155].
- Previously flagged:
  - Agile/adaptive vs predictive lifecycles (where requirements change frequently).
  - MVP as an example of **iterative/incremental** delivery.
  - Scope statement vs detailed dates (dates live in schedule baseline).

## 📈 Plan for Week 2

- Move into deeper **predictive/plan-based approaches** (Domain II).  
- Continue **daily flashcards** for all Domain I topics (Days 1–5).  
- Add new flashcards specifically on:
  - Differences among **scope, schedule, and cost baselines**.
  - Examples of when to choose **predictive, agile, or hybrid** lifecycles.
