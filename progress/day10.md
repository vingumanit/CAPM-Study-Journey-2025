## 🔍 Weak Areas

1. **Recognizing phase‑based hybrids (agile then predictive)**  
   - Pattern: Use **agile** early to explore/clarify requirements, then **lock scope and execute predictively** for deployment and rollout [web:11][web:14][web:6].  
   - Exam cue: Whenever different **phases** of one project use different approaches (e.g., adaptive discovery then predictive rollout), think **hybrid lifecycle**.

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add/adjust flashcards to emphasize:
  - Phase‑based hybrid: **agile early, predictive later**.  
  - Mixed‑component hybrid: predictive for stable parts, agile for innovative parts.  
- Day 11: Integrate **risk and stakeholder** concepts into predictive/agile/hybrid scenarios.
