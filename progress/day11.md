## 🔍 Weak Areas
- None for Day 11 (perfect score).  
- Reinforce patterns:
  - Predictive: **front-loaded risk analysis**, formal **risk register**, stakeholders mainly at **planning + phase gates** [web:21][web:23].  
  - Agile: **continuous risk handling** in iterations, risks surfaced via **reviews/retros**, frequent stakeholder feedback [web:24].  
  - Hybrid: overall **risk register and governance** plus agile teams raising risks from sprints into project-level tracking [web:29][web:39].

## 📈 Next Steps
- Day 12: Start mixing **scope/schedule/cost + risk + stakeholders** into integrated exam-style scenarios.  
- Turn any tricky CAPM questions encountered elsewhere into additional practice items.
