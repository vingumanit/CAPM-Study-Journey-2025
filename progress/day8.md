## 🔍 Weak Areas

1. **When the scope baseline is established**  
   - Correct flow: **Define Scope → Create WBS → Scope baseline**.  
   - Scope baseline = **scope statement + WBS + WBS dictionary** [web:141][web:139].

2. **Artifact to verify all requirements are delivered**  
   - Correct artifact: **Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**, which links requirements to WBS elements, deliverables, and tests [web:141].

3. **Process that breaks work packages into activities**  
   - Correct process: **Define Activities** – decomposes work packages into **activities** that can be estimated and scheduled [web:141].

4. **When the schedule baseline is created**  
   - Correct process: **Develop Schedule** – after analyzing sequences, durations, and resources, the approved schedule becomes the **schedule baseline** [web:155].

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add/adjust flashcards emphasizing:
  - **Define Scope & Create WBS → scope baseline**.
  - **RTM** as the tool for tracking requirements into WBS/deliverables/tests.
  - **Define Activities** (work packages → activities).
  - **Develop Schedule → schedule baseline**.
- Day 9: Start blending predictive and agile scenarios to prepare for hybrid questions.
- Continue daily review of Domain II flashcards (Days 6–8).
