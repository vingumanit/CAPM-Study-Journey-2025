## 🔍 Weak Areas
- None for Day 13 (perfect score).  
- Reinforce:
  - Reading long scenarios to identify **life cycle**, main domain (scope/schedule/cost/risk/stakeholder), and constraints.  
  - Choosing **analyze → communicate → act** instead of reacting without impact assessment.  
  - Keeping agile team decisions aligned with **predictive milestones and governance** in hybrid projects [web:47][web:52][web:53].

## 📈 Next Steps
- Day 14: Start **full-length exam blocks** (e.g., 25–30 questions) with mixed domains and timed practice.  
- Convert any tricky external questions into new mini-cases for additional drilling.
