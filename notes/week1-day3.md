# CAPM Study Journey — Day 3  
## Project Life Cycles & Tailoring (Domain I)

This lesson covers the **Predictive**, **Iterative**, **Incremental**, **Agile**, and **Hybrid** life cycles, plus the PMBOK 7 concept of **Tailoring**. A comparison table and real-world examples are included.

## 1. Project Life Cycles

### **Predictive Life Cycle (Waterfall)**
- Requirements are **fully defined upfront**.  
- Work proceeds through **sequential phases**: requirements → design → build → test → deploy.  
- Best for projects with **stable requirements** and **low uncertainty**.

### **Iterative Life Cycle**
- The solution is developed through **repeated cycles** to improve understanding.  
- Requirements may evolve; each cycle refines **scope clarity**.

### **Incremental Life Cycle**
- The product is delivered in **usable increments**, each adding functionality.  
- Stakeholders receive **working pieces early**.

### **Agile Life Cycle**
- Combines **iterative** and **incremental** development.  
- Requirements evolve; work delivered in **short iterations (sprints)**.  
- Focuses on **collaboration**, **adaptability**, and **continuous feedback**.

### **Hybrid Life Cycle**
- Mix of **predictive** and **agile**.  
- Stable components handled predictively; uncertain components handled with agile.

### **Tailoring**
- The act of **adapting methods, processes, tools, and the life cycle** to suit the project’s unique context.  
- Tailoring factors include:
  - Organizational environment  
  - Team capability  
  - Stakeholder needs  
  - Project complexity  
  - Delivery approach

## 2. Comparison Table

| **Life Cycle**  | **Requirements** | **Delivery Style** | **Change Flexibility** | **Best For** |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| **Predictive**   | Fixed            | Single final output | Low                      | Construction, engineering |
| **Iterative**    | Evolving         | Cycles of refinement | Medium                 | R&D, prototypes |
| **Incremental**  | Partially known  | Multiple increments | Medium                   | Software features |
| **Agile**        | Frequently changing | Short iterations | High                   | Startups, digital apps |
| **Hybrid**       | Mixed            | Combination         | Medium-High              | Complex enterprise systems |
| **Tailoring**    | Custom           | Depends on approach | Variable                 | Any project requiring customization |
