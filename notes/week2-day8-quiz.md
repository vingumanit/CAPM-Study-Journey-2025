### Missed Questions & Corrections

11. **The scope baseline is established during which group of processes?**  
- Correct: **Define Scope and Create WBS**.  
- Reason: **Collect Requirements** gathers needs, but the **scope baseline** is formed when the **project scope statement** (Define Scope) and the **WBS/WBS dictionary** (Create WBS) are completed [web:141][web:139].

12. **Which artifact is BEST for checking whether all approved requirements are included in the WBS and deliverables?**  
- Correct: **Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**.  
- Reason: The **RTM** links each requirement to WBS elements, deliverables, and tests, ensuring nothing is missed [web:141].

15. **You break work packages into specific actions that can be estimated and scheduled. Which process is this?**  
- Correct: **Define Activities**.  
- Reason: **Create WBS** creates work packages; **Define Activities** decomposes those work packages into **activities** that can be estimated and scheduled [web:141].

18. **The schedule baseline is first created at the end of:**  
- Correct: **Develop Schedule**.  
- Reason: After durations, dependencies, and resources are analyzed in **Develop Schedule**, the resulting approved schedule becomes the **schedule baseline** [web:155].

### Notes
- Reinforce flows:
  - **Collect Requirements → Define Scope → Create WBS → Scope baseline**.  
  - **Define Activities → Sequence Activities → Develop Schedule → Schedule baseline**.  
  - Use the **RTM** whenever the question is about tracing requirements into WBS/deliverables/tests.
