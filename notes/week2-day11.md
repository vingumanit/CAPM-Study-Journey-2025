# Day 11 – Risk & Stakeholders Across Predictive, Agile, and Hybrid

**Goal**: Understand how **risk management** and **stakeholder engagement** look different in predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches so you can quickly identify the best actions in exam scenarios [web:21][web:23][web:3].

## 1. Risk in Predictive vs Agile

### Predictive (Plan-Based) Risk Management

- Risk work is more **front-loaded**:
  - Major risk identification and analysis happen early in planning (e.g., risk register, qualitative/quantitative analysis).  
  - Emphasis on **preventive planning** and documented response strategies [web:23].

- Change and risk:
  - Changes are minimized; updates to risk responses or baselines usually go through **formal change control**.  
  - Detailed plans and buffers aim to reduce uncertainty and surprises.

### Agile / Adaptive Risk Management

- Risk work is more **continuous and iterative**:
  - Risks are identified and reviewed every **iteration**, often built into backlog refinement and planning.  
  - Delivery in **small increments** reduces exposure and allows early detection of issues [web:22][web:24].

- Change and risk:
  - Change is expected; teams adapt scope and priorities as risks emerge.  
  - Timeboxing and frequent feedback help manage both **threats and opportunities**.

## 2. Stakeholder Engagement – Predictive vs Agile

### Predictive Stakeholder Engagement

- Typical pattern:
  - Strong involvement at **start** (requirements, approvals) and at major **milestones/phase gates**.  
  - Feedback is often formal and periodic (status reports, formal reviews) [web:21][web:23].

- Risks:
  - If stakeholders are not engaged between milestones, misalignment may be discovered **late**.  
  - Communication relies heavily on **plans, forecasts, and reports**.

### Agile Stakeholder Engagement

- Typical pattern:
  - Stakeholders are engaged **throughout** via demos, reviews, and backlog discussions.  
  - Frequent, informal communication (e.g., reviews at the end of each iteration) [web:23][web:24].

- Benefits:
  - Misunderstandings are caught early; product alignment improves.  
  - Stakeholder feedback directly reprioritizes the backlog and can surface new risks early.

## 3. Hybrid – Blending Risk and Stakeholder Practices

- Hybrid combines:
  - Predictive-style **risk registers, plans, and governance** for the overall project.  
  - Agile-style **frequent touchpoints and adaptive responses** in iterative components [web:3][web:18].

- Example patterns:
  - Overall risk management plan and major risks documented at project level.  
  - Agile teams log and mitigate operational risks within sprints and raise significant ones to the project risk register.

- Stakeholders in hybrid:
  - Key sponsors may review progress at predictive **milestones**, while end users and product owners are deeply involved in agile **reviews and backlog refinement**.

## 4. Exam Cues – Risk & Stakeholders by Approach

- **Predictive cues**:
  - “Formal sign‑offs”, “phase gates”, “detailed upfront risk analysis”, “change control board”.  
  - Answer often involves **updating plans, risk register**, and following formal processes.

- **Agile cues**:
  - “Frequent demos”, “backlog refinement”, “iteration reviews and retrospectives”, “continuous stakeholder collaboration”.  
  - Answer often involves **adjusting backlog**, modifying approach in the next iteration, or collaborating with stakeholders [web:21][web:24].

- **Hybrid cues**:
  - “Overall governance and risk register” plus agile **iterations/sprints**.  
  - Answer may mix **formal risk management** at project level with **adaptive changes** at team level.

## 5. Typical Exam Actions by Approach

- In predictive scenarios:
  - Document the issue; **update the risk register**.  
  - Analyze impact, propose **risk responses**, and use formal **change control** if baselines are affected.

- In agile scenarios:
  - Raise the issue in the **next standup, review, or retrospective**.  
  - Adjust the **backlog, priorities, or approach** in the upcoming iteration to address the risk [web:22][web:24].

- In hybrid scenarios:
  - Decide whether the situation is a **team-level adjustment** (backlog, sprint plan) or a **project-level change** (baselines, major risks).  
  - Use both **adaptive team practices** and **formal project governance** where appropriate.
