B. Implement the change informally to show initiative  
C. Analyze the impact and, if beneficial, process a change request to update the schedule baseline  
D. Ignore the idea until the next project

3. In an agile project, the team’s velocity has been stable for several iterations. The product owner wants to commit to a fixed date and scope for an upcoming release. What is the BEST way to proceed?

A. Final product backlog  
B. Detailed project schedule  
C. Requirements documentation or stakeholder requirements specification

5. In a hybrid project, agile teams are developing features while a predictive team manages deployment and regulatory submissions. A change to a key requirement will impact deployment timelines. What should the project manager do FIRST?  
A. Ask agile teams to absorb the change with no impact to deployment  
B. Perform an integrated impact analysis on schedule, cost, and risk, then raise a change request if baselines are affected  
C. Let the deployment team decide without further analysis  
D. Tell stakeholders change is impossible in hybrid projects

6. A predictive project is in planning. The team is estimating activity durations and identifying dependencies. Which process are they performing?  
A. Define Activities  
B. Sequence Activities  
C. Develop Schedule  
D. Control Schedule

7. An agile team is frequently interrupted by ad hoc requests from stakeholders during sprints, causing missed sprint goals. What is the BEST corrective action?  
A. Encourage the team to work overtime to handle all requests  
B. Direct stakeholders to route requests through the product owner and backlog refinement instead of interrupting active sprints  
C. Cancel sprint planning and let the team pick up work daily  
D. Increase sprint length to fit more work

8. A stakeholder asks which document shows how each requirement will be traced from origin through design, build, and testing to final acceptance. What should the project manager reference?  
A. WBS  
B. Scope statement  
C. Requirements traceability matrix  
D. Communications management plan

9. In a predictive project, several high-priority risks have materialized, affecting cost and schedule. What should the project manager do NEXT?  
A. Blame the team for poor performance  
B. Implement the planned risk responses, update the risk register and project baselines as needed, and communicate impacts to stakeholders  
C. Immediately stop the project  
D. Remove the risks from the risk register since they have occurred

10. In an agile context, which statement BEST describes the purpose of the **definition of done** (DoD)?

B. It defines when a product backlog item is considered complete and of acceptable quality  
C. It defines the entire project scope  
D. It defines the organization’s reporting structure

11. A stakeholder complains that they receive too many technical details and not enough summary about project status. What should the project manager do?  
A. Continue sending the same reports because they are accurate  
B. Stop sending reports to that stakeholder  
C. Tailor communications to provide higher-level status and key risks in a format that matches the stakeholder’s needs  
D. Ask the stakeholder to adjust to the standard reporting format

12. A predictive project is in execution when the sponsor requests a change that improves business value but adds work. The PM performs impact analysis and sees that the budget and schedule will need to increase. What is the BEST next step?  
A. Implement the change immediately because it increases value  
B. Reject the change because it increases cost and time  
C. Submit a change request with impact analysis to the change control board or appropriate authority  
D. Informally ask the team to “do their best” without updating baselines

13. In an agile project, which activity MOST directly supports continuous improvement of the team’s process?

B. Brainstorming, interviews, and workshops with stakeholders  
C. Crashing the schedule  
D. Implementing lessons learned

15. An exam scenario describes: “Mixed predictive and agile teams; baselines and change control board for major changes; adaptive planning within sprints; heavy emphasis on integrated change control when scope/schedule/cost are impacted.” What is the MOST accurate label for this approach?  
A. Pure predictive  
B. Pure agile  
C. Hybrid  
D. Informal

### Missed Questions & Corrections

6. **A predictive project is in planning. The team is estimating activity durations and identifying dependencies. Which process are they performing?**  
- Correct: **Develop Schedule**.  
- Reason: Estimating durations and identifying dependencies are key steps when building the **project schedule**, which is part of the **Develop Schedule** process; Define/Sequence Activities happen earlier and focus on listing and ordering activities, not integrating durations and dependencies into a full schedule model.[web:73][web:75][web:76]

8. **A stakeholder asks which document shows how each requirement will be traced from origin through design, build, and testing to final acceptance. What should the project manager reference?**  
- Correct: **Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**.  
- Reason: The **RTM** links each requirement from its source through design, development, and test/acceptance, ensuring every requirement is tracked to deliverables and test cases.[web:77][web:79]
