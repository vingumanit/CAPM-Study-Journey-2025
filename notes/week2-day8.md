# Day 8 – Predictive Practice Focus: Requirements, WBS, Schedule, Budget

**Goal**: Reinforce Domain II predictive planning by briefly recapping **requirements → scope → WBS → schedule → cost** so practice questions stick better [web:141].

---

## 1. Requirements to Scope

- **Collect Requirements**: Document stakeholder needs (**what they want**) using interviews, workshops, surveys, prototypes.  
- Outputs: **Requirements documentation**, **requirements traceability matrix** (RTM) – links requirements to deliverables, tests, and objectives.

- **Define Scope**: Converts requirements into the **project scope statement** (deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, constraints, exclusions).  
- Scope statement + WBS + WBS dictionary = **scope baseline** [web:139].

---

## 2. WBS to Activities & Schedule

- **Create WBS**: Decomposes project scope into **work packages** (manageable units for estimating and control).  
- **Define Activities**: Breaks work packages into **activities**.  
- **Sequence Activities**: Orders activities and creates **network diagrams**.  
- **Develop Schedule**: Uses durations, dependencies, and resources to produce the **project schedule** and identify the **critical path**; output = **schedule baseline** [web:141].

---

## 3. Estimates to Cost Baseline

- **Estimate Costs**: Produces **cost estimates** and **basis of estimates** using analogous, parametric, bottom‑up, etc.  
- **Determine Budget**: Aggregates estimates and funding requirements to create the **project budget** and **cost baseline** (time‑phased) [web:155].

## 4. Change Control Reminder

Any change affecting **scope, schedule, or cost** should:  
1) Be **documented** as a change request,  
2) Have its impact analyzed, and  
3) Go through **formal change control**; if approved, baselines are updated and communicated [web:141].
