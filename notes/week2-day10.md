# Day 10 – Hybrid Planning: Baselines + Backlogs

**Goal**: Understand how **predictive baselines** (scope, schedule, cost) and **agile artifacts** (backlogs, iterations) work together in a **hybrid** life cycle and how exam questions describe this mix [web:5][web:7][web:9].

---

## 1. Hybrid Life Cycle – Recap

- **Hybrid** = tailored mix of predictive and agile to fit project needs.  
- Common pattern: predictive for **stable** parts, agile for **uncertain/innovative** parts [web:5][web:9].

---

## 2. Baselines in Hybrid Projects

- **Baselines (predictive side)**:
  - Scope baseline: scope statement + WBS + WBS dictionary.  
  - Schedule baseline: approved schedule.  
  - Cost baseline: time‑phased approved budget [web:7].

- In hybrid:
  - These baselines still exist for **predictive components** and overall governance.  
  - Changes impacting baselines must go through **formal change control / integrated change control** [web:7][web:10].

---

## 3. Agile Artifacts in Hybrid Projects

- **Agile side** typically uses:
  - Product backlog (ordered list of features/requirements).  
  - Iterations/sprints, sprint backlog, frequent demos and retrospectives [web:5][web:8].

- In hybrid:
  - Agile teams deliver increments inside the **overall project constraints** (time/cost objectives from predictive planning).  
  - Backlog items must respect major milestones and high‑level scope boundaries.

## 4. How Hybrid Planning Looks

Examples:
- Predictive:
  - High‑level **roadmap**, phase dates, major releases, budget and milestone baselines.  
- Agile:
  - Within a release or phase, the team plans **iterations**, pulling from the backlog and adapting details each sprint [web:5][web:9].

Key idea:
- Hybrid keeps **baseline control** at the overall level, but allows **flexible, adaptive delivery** inside certain boundaries.

## 5. Exam Cues for Hybrid + Baselines

Look for:
- “Core platform with fixed regulatory requirements, but experimental features delivered in sprints.”  
- “Overall project budget and milestones approved, but detailed scope of features refined each iteration.”  
- “Predictive planning for procurement and infrastructure; agile for software or AI components” [web:5][web:9].

When a question:
- Mentions **formal change control and baselines** AND **iterations/backlog**, the answer is often **hybrid**.
