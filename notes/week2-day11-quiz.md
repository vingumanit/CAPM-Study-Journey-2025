B. Only through a formal risk register maintained by the PMO  
C. As an ongoing activity in each iteration, often via backlog refinement and reviews  
D. Only through annual audits

3. A project uses sprints and demos. The team regularly discusses what went wrong and what to improve at the end of each iteration. Which meeting best supports **risk and process improvement** in this context?  
A. Phase gate review  
B. Retrospective  
C. Contract negotiation session

B. Ignore it until it becomes an issue  
C. Analyze the risk, update the risk register, and consider response strategies

5. In an **agile** project, a major risk is discovered that could affect the next release. What is the BEST initial response?  
A. Freeze the backlog and stop the project  
B. Raise it in the team events (e.g., standup or planning), adjust backlog priorities, and plan mitigation work  
C. Wait until the end of the project  
D. Escalate directly to a formal change control board for every small risk

6. Which statement BEST describes stakeholder involvement in a **predictive** life cycle?

B. Stakeholders provide feedback regularly through reviews and collaboration during and between iterations  
C. Stakeholders are not needed once the backlog is created  
D. Stakeholders only receive formal reports quarterly

8. A project is managed with an overall predictive plan and risk register, but software delivery teams work in sprints and raise new risks during their retrospectives. Significant risks are then added to the main project risk register. What type of approach is this?  
A. Pure predictive  
B. Pure agile  
C. Hybrid  
D. Informal

9. In a predictive project, which document MOST commonly lists identified risks, their analysis, and planned responses?  
A. Stakeholder engagement plan  
B. Risk register  
C. Scope statement  
D. Product backlog

10. In an agile context, where are technical and business risks often reflected so they can be addressed in upcoming work?  
A. Risk register only  
B. Product backlog and iteration planning  
C. Project charter only  
D. Communications plan

11. A sponsor in a predictive project wants to reduce the level of risk on the project. Which of the following is the BEST response?  
A. Remove risky work from the scope without analysis  
B. Use more detailed planning, risk responses, and possibly additional reserves  
C. Stop involving stakeholders  
D. Avoid documenting risks

12. A stakeholder complains late in a predictive project that expectations were not met, even though all scope was delivered per the plan. What is the BEST lesson for future projects?  
A. Reduce communication to stakeholders  
B. Engage stakeholders more frequently and manage expectations through better communication and requirements validation  
C. Avoid documenting agreements  
D. Move all future projects to agile without considering suitability

13. A stakeholder in an agile project frequently changes priorities based on market feedback. The team is struggling to keep up. What is the BEST action?  
A. Lock the backlog and refuse changes  
B. Use backlog refinement and prioritization rules (e.g., product owner decisions) to manage changes, ensuring they fit within capacity  
C. Let everyone change the backlog at any time  
D. Ignore the stakeholder

14. In a hybrid project, which situation should MOST likely trigger **formal change control** rather than just backlog reprioritization?  
A. Changing the order of items within the same iteration  
B. Swapping equal-sized features without affecting release dates  
C. A change that will impact the approved schedule or cost baselines  
D. Re-wording acceptance criteria for clarity

15. An exam scenario describes: “Most risks documented up front with detailed analysis; stakeholders engaged mainly at phase gates; changes carefully controlled through a change control board.” Which development approach is MOST likely being described?

B. Predictive  
C. Hybrid
