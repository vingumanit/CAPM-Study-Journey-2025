### Missed Question & Correction

- **Question:** “The scope statement typically includes all of the following EXCEPT:”  
  - **Correct answer:** Detailed activity start and finish dates  
  - **Why:** The **scope statement** describes project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, constraints, and exclusions, while detailed dates belong in the **project schedule** and **schedule baseline**, not in the scope statement [web:141][web:155].

### Notes
- Re‑review the difference between **scope statement** (what work and boundaries) and **schedule** (when work happens).
- Remember: scope = *what*, schedule = *when*, cost = *how much*.
