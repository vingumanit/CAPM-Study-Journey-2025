# Day 14 – Timed Mixed-Domain Exam Blocks

**Goal**: Practice **mixed-domain, exam-style blocks** (like 25–30 questions) under time pressure, integrating fundamentals, predictive, agile, and business analysis concepts [web:68][web:70].

---

## 1. CAPM Exam Mix – Reminder

Approximate domain split (ECO-based, 2025-style):

- Project Management **Fundamentals and Core Concepts**.  
- **Predictive** (plan-based) methodologies.  
- **Agile** frameworks/methodologies.  
- **Business analysis** frameworks (requirements, stakeholders, value) [web:70].

Mixed blocks will:

- Shuffle questions from all domains.  
- Emphasize **scenario-based** “best answer” choices with a close second-best option [web:70].

---

## 2. Timed Block Strategy

For a 25–30 question block:

- Time target: about **1 minute per question** (practice slightly faster than exam pace) [web:66][web:68].  
- Strategy:
  - First pass: answer everything you are **reasonably sure of**.  
  - Mark and return: flag items that need extra thought.  
  - Avoid spending more than ~60–75 seconds on a single item on first pass.

Key habits:

- Read the **question stem last** if long, focusing on “What should the PM do NEXT/BEST?”  
- Identify **life cycle** and domain quickly (predictive vs agile vs hybrid; scope vs schedule vs cost vs risk vs stakeholders).

---

## 3. Handling Close Second-Best Answers

CAPM questions often present:

- One **best** answer and one **almost right** answer [web:70].  

Heuristics:

- Prefer actions that:
  - Are **proactive** (analyze, plan, communicate).  
  - Follow the **appropriate process** for the life cycle.  
  - Engage **stakeholders** and use defined artifacts (risk register, backlog, baselines).

- Avoid answers that:
  - Skip **impact analysis** before big changes.  
  - Bypass governance (CCB, change control) when baselines are affected.  
  - Ignore risk or stakeholder engagement.

## 4. Using Exam Artifacts in Scenario Thinking

In mixed blocks, look for which artifact is most relevant:

- Predictive:
  - **Project management plan**, baselines, WBS, risk register, issue log, change request.  
- Agile:
  - **Product backlog**, sprint backlog, definition of done, velocity, reviews/retrospectives.  
- Business analysis:
  - **Requirements documentation**, requirements traceability matrix, stakeholder register, business case [web:63][web:70].

Let the artifact guide:

- Where to **record** information.  
- How to **decide** the next step (e.g., trade-off analysis, backlog reprioritization, formal approval).

## 5. Feedback Loop After Each Block

After a timed block:

- Record:
  - **Score**, time taken, and any “guessed” questions.  
- Analyze:
  - Which **domain** or **approach** (predictive/agile/hybrid/BA) you miss most.  
  - Which **thinking error** occurred (rushed, skipped impact analysis, ignored stakeholder, etc.) [web:42][web:68].

Adjust:

- Convert missed or shaky items into **flashcards** or **mini-cases**.  
- Re-run smaller blocks focusing on weaker domains.
