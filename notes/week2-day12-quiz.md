## Instructions
Answer all questions before checking the answers at the end.

1. A predictive project is in execution when a stakeholder requests an additional feature that will extend the schedule by two weeks and increase cost. What should the project manager do FIRST?  
A. Add the feature immediately to keep the stakeholder happy  
B. Reject the request because the schedule baseline is already approved  
C. Analyze the impact on scope, schedule, cost, and risk, then submit a change request  
D. Update the issue log only

2. An agile team discovers mid‑iteration that a key feature is riskier and more complex than expected. The sponsor still wants it in the next release. What is the BEST action?  
A. Extend the iteration until the feature is done  
B. Raise the risk in team events, consider breaking it into smaller backlog items or a spike, and re‑plan in upcoming iterations  
C. Freeze further changes and keep the current plan  
D. Escalate directly to a change control board to change the scope baseline

3. In a hybrid project, software is developed in sprints while infrastructure is managed predictively. A new regulatory requirement will add work to both areas and likely increase the budget. What should the project manager do?  
A. Let the agile team simply add the work to the next sprint  
B. Ask infrastructure to absorb the change with existing resources  
C. Perform an integrated impact analysis and submit a change request for budget and schedule if needed  
D. Ignore the regulatory change until testing

4. A predictive project is running behind schedule. The sponsor pressures the project manager to crash activities without additional funding. What is the BEST response?  
A. Agree and crash the schedule without analysis  
B. Explain options, analyze impact on cost, risk, and quality, and present trade‑offs before making a decision  
C. Ignore the sponsor’s request  
D. Ask the team to work overtime indefinitely without documenting anything

5. In an agile project, a key stakeholder is not attending reviews and is surprised by the product direction. What should the project manager or team lead do?  
A. Continue as is; reviews are optional  
B. Escalate immediately to terminate the stakeholder’s involvement  
C. Work with the stakeholder to understand constraints, adjust meeting times/formats, and reinforce the importance of regular feedback  
D. Remove the stakeholder from the stakeholder register

6. A stakeholder in a predictive project is unhappy that a minor scope change request was rejected by the change control board. What is the BEST way for the project manager to respond?  
A. Bypass the board and implement the change secretly  
B. Explain the change control process, share the impact analysis, and discuss alternative solutions or future change requests  
C. Tell the stakeholder they have no authority  
D. Ignore the complaint

7. In a hybrid project, an agile team wants to add a new innovative feature that fits within the current release timeframe and budget, but it was not in the original high‑level scope. What is the BEST next step?  
A. Automatically add the feature without informing anyone  
B. Refuse the idea because it was not in the scope baseline  
C. Evaluate whether the feature affects agreed high‑level scope or benefits and, if not, manage it via backlog prioritization and stakeholder alignment  
D. Immediately raise a formal change request to update all baselines

8. A predictive project risk with high probability and high impact has been identified early in planning. What should the project manager do?  
A. Note it mentally and continue planning without documentation  
B. Document it in the risk register, perform qualitative (and possibly quantitative) analysis, and plan an appropriate response  
C. Wait to see if it actually happens before acting  
D. Transfer all risks automatically to insurance

9. In an agile project, during a retrospective the team notes that unclear requirements are causing rework and delays. What is the BEST action to improve performance?  
A. Stop involving stakeholders to avoid confusion  
B. Add more upfront documentation and forbid changes  
C. Improve collaboration with the product owner and stakeholders, and clarify requirements earlier via workshops or refinement sessions  
D. Ignore the feedback and keep the same process

10. A hybrid project has an approved schedule baseline with key milestones. An agile team wants to extend their current sprint by a week to finish more work, which would delay a milestone. What should the project manager do?  
A. Allow the team to extend the sprint without further steps  
B. Automatically update the schedule baseline without approval  
C. Assess impact on the milestone and, if it affects the baseline, process a change request or keep the sprint timebox and adjust scope  
D. Ignore the issue because agile welcomes change

11. A predictive project is within scope and cost but quality defects are high and stakeholders are dissatisfied. What should the project manager focus on FIRST?  
A. Cutting scope to meet deadlines  
B. Reviewing and improving quality management and stakeholder communication, including validation of requirements and acceptance criteria  
C. Increasing risk reserves  
D. Changing the development approach to agile immediately

12. An agile team is consistently missing its sprint goals due to overcommitting. What is the BEST corrective action?  
A. Increase team overtime permanently  
B. Reduce transparency of progress to avoid pressure  
C. Use past velocity to make more realistic commitments and improve estimation during sprint planning  
D. Extend sprint length until goals are met

13. In a predictive project, a stakeholder asks for a detailed status update. The project manager has schedule, cost, and risk data available. What is the BEST way to respond?  
A. Provide a clear status report integrating schedule, cost, and risk information tailored to the stakeholder’s needs  
B. Send raw project data without explanation  
C. Tell the stakeholder to wait until project closing  
D. Share only schedule information

14. A hybrid project uses both predictive and agile teams. A major risk identified by an agile team could affect overall project delivery dates. What should the project manager do?  
A. Keep the risk within the agile team and tell them to “work harder”  
B. Add the risk to the project risk register, analyze impact on schedule and cost, and coordinate responses across both predictive and agile teams  
C. Ignore it because hybrid projects accept more risk  
D. Ask only the predictive team to manage it

15. An exam scenario describes: “Detailed upfront planning with baselines; change requests analyzed formally; some components delivered in sprints with frequent stakeholder feedback. Major changes to cost or schedule still go through a change control board.” What approach is MOST likely being used?  
A. Pure predictive  
B. Pure agile  
C. Hybrid  
D. Informal

**Score**: **15/15** 🎯

### Notes
- Strong ability to:
  - Recognize when to use **integrated change control** for baseline impacts.  
  - Use **backlog refinement and team events** in agile and hybrid contexts instead of forcing formal change for every adjustment.  
  - Blend predictive baselines with agile delivery decisions in **hybrid** scenarios [web:48][web:52][web:53].
