# Day 13 – Mini-Case Scenario Chains

**Goal**: Practice longer **mini-case** scenarios where multiple decisions are needed, mixing scope, schedule, cost, risk, stakeholders, and development approach (predictive/agile/hybrid) [web:59][web:60][web:42].

---

## 1. Reading a Mini-Case

When facing a long scenario:

- Identify:
  - **Life cycle**: predictive, agile, or hybrid.  
  - Main theme: **scope, schedule, cost, risk, stakeholders, or change**.  
- Watch for:
  - Words like **baseline, CCB, phase gate** (predictive).  
  - **Sprints, backlog, demos, retrospectives** (agile).  
  - Predictive plan + agile teams (hybrid) [web:60][web:36].

---

## 2. Chaining Decisions

Mini-cases often ask several questions about the same situation:

- Early questions: often about **planning and risk**.  
- Later questions: often about **change control, stakeholder responses, or corrective actions**.

Strategy:

- Keep a mental model of:
  - What has already been **approved** (scope/schedule/cost).  
  - Which risks and issues have been identified.  
  - How stakeholders are currently engaged [web:59][web:47].

## 3. Typical Patterns in Mini-Cases

- Predictive mini-case:
  - Detailed plans, baselines, and a **change control board**.  
  - Questions focus on **integrated change control**, risk responses, and stakeholder communication.

- Agile mini-case:
  - Iterations, product backlog, and frequent feedback.  
  - Questions focus on **backlog management**, team events, and adapting based on learning [web:60].

- Hybrid mini-case:
  - Predictive milestones and baselines plus agile teams.  
  - Questions focus on deciding whether to use **formal change control** or **agile events/backlog changes** [web:5][web:53].

---

## 4. “Best Next Action” Heuristics

- Prefer actions that:
  - **Analyze** before acting (impact on objectives).  
  - **Communicate** with affected stakeholders.  
  - Use the **appropriate process** for the life cycle in the scenario.

- Avoid answers that:
  - Ignore processes or stakeholders.  
  - Make big changes with **no analysis**.  
  - React emotionally or bypass governance [web:42][web:51].

## 5. Exam Practice Focus for Today

- Treat each question as part of a **story**: what has already happened and what constraints exist.  
- Practice spotting:
  - When to use **integrated change control** vs backlog refinement.  
  - When the real problem is **risk, quality, or stakeholder expectations**, even if the question mentions schedule or cost [web:59][web:47][web:36].
