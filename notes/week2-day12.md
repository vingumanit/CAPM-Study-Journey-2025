# Day 12 – Integrated Scenarios (Scope, Schedule, Cost, Risk, Stakeholders)

**Goal**: Practice reading scenario questions that mix **scope, schedule, cost, risk, and stakeholder** elements across predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches, and choosing the MOST appropriate next action [web:42][web:36][web:45].

## 1. Integrated Change Control – Key Idea

- Any time a scenario suggests a change affecting **scope, schedule, or cost baselines**, think **formal change control**.  
- Typical steps:
  - Identify and document the change.  
  - Analyze impact on **scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, stakeholders**.  
  - Present to the appropriate authority (e.g., **change control board**) for decision [web:44][web:47].

## 2. Predictive Scenario Patterns

Look for cues like:
- Fixed scope, detailed plans, **WBS, baselines**, strict contracts.  
- Stakeholders mainly at **phase gates**; formal reports.

Common “best next step” actions:
- Update the **risk register** or issue log.  
- Analyze impacts before approving changes.  
- Follow the **change management plan** and seek approval before modifying baselines [web:44][web:45].

## 3. Agile Scenario Patterns

Look for cues like:
- **Iterations/sprints**, product backlog, frequent demos, evolving requirements.  
- Stakeholders involved regularly; team self‑organizing.

Common “best next step” actions:
- Discuss in **standup, review, or retrospective**.  
- Adjust the **product backlog**, priorities, or approach for the next iteration.  
- Deliver small increments and use feedback to manage risk and value [web:36][web:38].

---

## 4. Hybrid Scenario Patterns

Look for cues like:
- Overall **predictive plan** (baselines, governance) plus agile teams working in **sprints**.  
- Predictive for **infrastructure/procurement**, agile for **software/features**.

Common “best next step” actions:
- Decide whether the issue is **team-level** (backlog, sprint scope) or **project-level** (baselines, major risk).  
- Use **formal change control** for baseline impacts, and agile events for team adjustments [web:5][web:46][web:39].

---

## 5. Exam Strategy for Scenarios

- Identify:
  - Life cycle: **predictive, agile, or hybrid**.  
  - Domain: is the question really about **scope, schedule, cost, risk, or stakeholders**?  
- Then choose the action that:
  - Is **proactive** (analyze, communicate, plan) rather than reactive.  
  - Uses the **right mechanism** for the approach (change control vs backlog refinement vs hybrid combination) [web:42][web:45].
