# Day 6 – Domain II Overview: Predictive / Plan-Based Approaches

**Goal**: Begin CAPM **Domain II** by understanding how predictive (plan‑based) projects are structured: phases, roles, key plans and baselines, and how this links to Domain I fundamentals [web:141][web:139].

---

## 1. What Domain II Covers (High Level)

- Focus: **Predictive project management approaches**.  
- Emphasis on:
  - Defining and controlling **scope, schedule, and cost**.
  - Using detailed **plans and baselines** to track performance.
  - Applying consistent processes across phases (initiating → closing) [web:141].

---

## 2. Predictive Project Phases & Process Groups

- Projects are often divided into **phases** (e.g., concept, design, build, test).  
- Each phase typically goes through the 5 **process groups**:
  - **Initiating** – authorize phase/project.
  - **Planning** – detail scope, schedule, cost, risks, etc.
  - **Executing** – perform the planned work.
  - **Monitoring & Controlling** – track, compare to baselines, manage changes.
  - **Closing** – formally complete the phase/project [web:139].

---

## 3. Key Roles in Predictive Projects

- **Project Manager** – leads planning and integration, manages baselines and change control.  
- **Sponsor** – approves major plans and changes that impact scope, time, or cost.  
- **Functional managers** – provide resources and subject-matter expertise.  
- **Project team** – develops estimates, plans, and deliverables [web:141].

---

## 4. Core Planning Artifacts (Predictive)

- **Project Management Plan** – integrated plan that consolidates:
  - Scope, schedule, and cost management plans.
  - Subsidiary plans (quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, stakeholder management).  
- **Baselines** (review from Domain I):
  - **Scope baseline** – scope statement, WBS, WBS dictionary.
  - **Schedule baseline** – approved dates and milestones.
  - **Cost baseline** – time-phased budget [web:155].

---

## 5. Why Predictive Approaches Are Used

- **Best fit** when:
  - Requirements are **stable** and well-known.
  - Regulatory or contractual environments demand **fixed scope and dates**.
  - Detailed cost/schedule control is critical (e.g., construction, infrastructure) [web:141].

**Day 6 outcome**: Recognize what Domain II is about and how predictive projects are planned and controlled beyond just the basic definitions from Domain I.
