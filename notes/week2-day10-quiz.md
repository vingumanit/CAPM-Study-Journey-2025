A. Pure predictive  
B. Pure agile  
C. Hybrid

A. Let the agile team re‑prioritize the backlog without further steps  
B. Submit a **change request** through formal change control  
C. Ignore the change because agile welcomes change  
D. Update only the risk register

3. Which BEST describes how **baselines** are used in hybrid projects?  
A. Not used at all  
B. Used only by agile teams  
C. Used to control overall scope, schedule, and cost, while teams may use agile methods inside those boundaries  
D. Replaced entirely by backlogs

4. A question mentions an approved WBS, schedule baseline, and cost baseline, plus a product backlog for detailed feature work. What is this MOST likely describing?  
A. Pure predictive project  
B. Pure agile project  
C. Hybrid project  
D. Program management

5. Which artifact is MOST associated with **predictive** planning, not agile?  
A. Product backlog  
B. Sprint backlog  
C. Scope baseline  
D. Daily standup notes

6. In a hybrid environment, which statement is MOST accurate about **backlog changes**?  
A. Backlog changes never require any approval  
B. Backlog changes are always baseline changes  
C. Backlog items can change within iterations as long as they stay inside the approved overall baselines  
D. Backlog changes automatically change the cost baseline

7. A project uses predictive planning for site construction and procurement but manages software features with sprints, reviews, and retrospectives. Which life cycle is this?  
A. Predictive  
B. Agile  
C. Hybrid  
D. Iterative only

8. What is the main purpose of **formal change control** in a hybrid project?  
A. To stop agile teams from changing anything  
B. To manage changes that impact approved baselines (scope, schedule, cost)  
C. To schedule standups  
D. To prioritize backlog items

9. Which of the following BEST shows **alignment** between agile delivery and predictive baselines?  
A. Agile team works independently without regard to project deadlines  
B. Agile team plans sprints so that increments align with major predictive milestones and budget limits  
C. Project manager ignores agile metrics  
D. Predictive side always overrides agile estimates

10. A sponsor asks to add a new feature that will extend the project duration beyond the approved schedule baseline. In a hybrid project, what should the PM do?  
A. Immediately accept and add it to the backlog  
B. Reject it without analysis  
C. Analyze impact and raise a change request to update the schedule baseline  
D. Tell the agile team to absorb the work with no time change

11. Which is LEAST likely to be used as a **predictive control tool** in a hybrid project?  
A. Cost baseline  
B. Schedule baseline  
C. Product backlog  
D. Scope baseline

12. In an exam scenario, you see: “High‑level scope and budget fixed; agile teams iterate within those constraints to refine and deliver features.” What is the BEST answer?  
A. Predictive planning only  
B. Agile only  
C. Hybrid lifecycle  
D. No formal method

13. Which statement about **re‑baselining** is MOST correct in a hybrid context?  
A. Baselines are changed informally by the agile team  
B. Baselines can only be changed by the sponsor without any analysis  
C. Baselines may be updated, but only through formal change control when major shifts occur  
D. Baselines are updated after every sprint

14. Which combination BEST represents hybrid planning?  
A. Scope baseline + product backlog + sprints under one governance structure  
B. Only product backlog and burn‑down chart  
C. Only WBS and Gantt chart  
D. Only retrospectives and demos

15. A project uses agile methods for early requirements discovery, then locks down scope and follows a predictive plan for deployment. This is an example of:  
A. Pure agile  
B. Pure predictive  
C. Hybrid lifecycle  
D. Uncontrolled change

### Missed Question & Correction

15. **A project uses agile methods for early requirements discovery, then locks down scope and follows a predictive plan for deployment. This is an example of:**  
- Correct: **Hybrid lifecycle**.  
- Reason: Using **agile/adaptive** practices in early phases (to explore/clarify requirements) and then switching to a **predictive/plan‑based** rollout is a classic **hybrid pattern** that combines both approaches in different phases of the same project [web:11][web:14][web:6].
