# Day 5 – Domain I Recap: Fundamentals, Principles, Lifecycles, Predictive Basics

**Goal**: Consolidate CAPM **Domain I** – fundamentals (roles, tailoring), **12 principles**, **lifecycles**, and **predictive planning** (scope/WBS, baselines, critical path, cost baseline) [web:141][web:139].

## 1. Fundamentals: Projects, Roles, Tailoring

- A **project** is a temporary endeavor to create a **unique product, service, or result**.  
- Key roles:  
  - **Project Manager (PM)** – accountable for meeting project objectives.  
  - **Sponsor** – authorizes the project (charter), secures funding, provides high‑level support.  
  - **Team members** – perform the work.  
  - **Stakeholders** – individuals/groups affected by the project [web:141].  

- **Tailoring**: Adapting processes, tools, and techniques to the **specific context** of the project rather than applying a standard blindly (organization, team, product, regulatory environment) [web:141].

## 2. The 12 Project Management Principles (PMBOK 7)

Principles are **behavioral guidelines**, independent of method (predictive/agile):

1. **Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward** – act ethically and responsibly with resources and people.  
2. **Create a collaborative project team environment** – encourage trust and psychological safety.  
3. **Effectively engage with stakeholders** – communicate and involve them continuously.  
4. **Focus on value** – deliver and protect value throughout the project.  
5. **Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions** – understand complexity and interdependencies.  
6. **Demonstrate leadership behaviors** – guide, motivate, and support the team.  
7. **Tailor based on context** – adjust approach to fit project conditions.  
8. **Build quality into processes and deliverables** – prevent defects rather than only inspect them.  
9. **Navigate complexity** – continuously sense, analyze, and respond to emerging complexity.  
10. **Optimize risk responses** – balance threats and opportunities.  
11. **Foster adaptability and resilience** – respond effectively to change and disruption.  
12. **Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state** – support transition from current to desired state [web:141].

## 3. Lifecycles: Predictive vs Agile vs Hybrid

- **Predictive (plan‑based)**  
  - **Scope, schedule, and cost** are defined early and changes are tightly controlled.  
  - Heavy **upfront planning**; best when requirements are **stable and well‑known** [web:141].  

- **Agile / Adaptive**  
  - Delivers in **short iterations** or increments; expects and welcomes **changing requirements**.  
  - Plans in more detail for near‑term work; relies on frequent feedback and continuous stakeholder engagement [web:141].  

- **Hybrid**  
  - Combines predictive and agile elements; e.g., predictive for hardware or infrastructure, agile for software features [web:139].  

**Quick comparison**

| Aspect            | Predictive                        | Agile/Adaptive                       | Hybrid                                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Requirements      | Stable, defined early [web:141]   | Evolving, refined each iteration [web:141] | Some stable, some evolving           |
| Planning style    | Heavy upfront                     | Rolling-wave, just-in-time           | Mixed by component                    |
| Change handling   | Formal change control             | Built into backlog refinement        | Mix of both                           |
| Delivery          | One main release / phases         | Frequent increments/iterations       | Combination                           |

## 4. Predictive Planning Basics: Scope, WBS, Baselines, Critical Path

- **Project scope**: Work required to deliver the product, service, or result.  
- **Scope statement**: Narrative describing **scope, major deliverables, assumptions, constraints, and exclusions** (not detailed dates) [web:141].  
- **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**: Hierarchical decomposition of total project work into **work packages**; together with scope statement and WBS dictionary forms the **scope baseline** [web:139].

**Baselines**

- **Scope baseline**  
  - Components: **scope statement + WBS + WBS dictionary**.  
  - Focus: **What work** is included.

- **Schedule baseline**  
  - Approved project schedule with **start/finish dates and milestones**.  
  - Focus: **When work** happens; used to track schedule variance [web:155].

- **Cost baseline**  
  - **Time‑phased, approved budget** (excluding management reserves).  
  - Focus: **How much it should cost**; used for cost performance and earned value [web:155].

**Critical Path**

- **Critical path**: Longest path through the schedule network with **zero total float**, determining the **shortest possible project duration** [web:141].  
- Activities on the critical path require the closest monitoring; delay usually delays the whole project.

## 5. Exam Tips for Domain I

- Map each **baseline** to its focus: **scope = what**, **schedule = when**, **cost = how much** [web:141].  
- In lifecycle questions, look for clues: **stable requirements → predictive**, **frequent change & feedback → agile**, **mixed components → hybrid** [web:139].  
- For principle questions, answers that stress **stakeholder engagement, value delivery, collaboration, tailoring, and adaptability** are often correct [web:141].  
- Remember that **scope statement ≠ schedule** – detailed dates and milestones live in the **schedule baseline**, not in the scope statement [web:155].  
- For schedule questions, keep “**critical path = longest path, zero float, controls finish date**” clearly in mind [web:141].
