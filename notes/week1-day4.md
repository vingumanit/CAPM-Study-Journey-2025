# CAPM Day 4: Predictive Planning Basics – Scope, WBS, Schedule, Cost

**Focus**: How predictive (plan-based) projects define and lock **scope**, **schedule**, and **cost** using baselines for performance measurement [web:141].

---

## 1. Project Scope & Scope Statement

- **Project scope**: The work performed to deliver specified **products, services, or results** with defined features and functions [web:141].  
- **Scope statement**: A detailed narrative description of project scope, major deliverables, **assumptions**, **constraints**, and **exclusions**. It does **not** contain detailed activity start/finish dates (those belong to the schedule).

**Key points:**
- Clarifies what is **in** and **out** of the project.
- Provides a foundation for the **WBS** and for managing scope changes.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) & Scope Baseline

- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: A **hierarchical decomposition** of the total project work into smaller, manageable components called **work packages** [web:139].  
- **Work package**: Lowest WBS level where **cost and duration** can be reliably estimated.

- **Scope baseline** =  
  - Approved **scope statement**  
  - **WBS**  
  - **WBS dictionary** (details about each WBS element: description, owner, assumptions, etc.) [web:141]

**Purpose:**
- Ensures all required work is identified (no more, no less).
- Serves as reference when evaluating proposed scope changes.

## 3. Schedule: Activities, Sequencing, Critical Path

- **Activity**: A scheduled piece of work needed to produce a deliverable.  
- **Sequencing activities**: Determining **logical relationships** among activities (finish‑to‑start, start‑to‑start, etc.) to build a **network diagram** [web:139].  
- **Network diagram**: Graphical representation of activities and dependencies.

- **Critical path**:  
  - The **longest path** through the network diagram.  
  - Has **zero total float**.  
  - Determines the **shortest possible project duration**; delay on critical path activities delays the project if nothing else changes [web:141].

- **Schedule baseline**: The **approved project schedule**, including planned start/finish dates, used as the reference for tracking **schedule performance** and variance [web:155].

---

## 4. Cost Estimates & Cost Baseline

- **Cost estimate**: An approximation of the **monetary resources** needed to complete activities, work packages, or the whole project [web:141].  
  - Can be rough early (e.g., analogous estimates) and more detailed after WBS is complete (**bottom‑up estimating**).

- **Cost baseline**:  
  - The **time‑phased, approved budget** (often shown as an **S‑curve**) against which actual cost is compared.  
  - Excludes management reserves; used in **Earned Value Management (EVM)** to compute cost variance and performance [web:155].

## 5. How Baselines Work Together

Predictive projects typically establish and control three major baselines:

- **Scope baseline** → What work is included.  
- **Schedule baseline** → When the work should occur.  
- **Cost baseline** → How much the work should cost.

These baselines are used together to:

- Approve or reject **change requests** (formal change control).  
- Measure **performance**: scope, time, and cost variances against the plan [web:141][web:155].

## 6. Simple Examples

1. **House construction**  
   - Scope statement: 3‑bedroom house with defined features.  
   - WBS: Foundation, framing, roofing, electrical, plumbing.  
   - Schedule baseline: Planned dates for each phase.  
   - Cost baseline: Total budget spread over months.

2. **Highway project**  
   - Sequenced activities (design → permits → earthworks → paving).  
   - Critical path runs through the longest chain; any delay here delays opening of the highway [web:139].

3. **Conference planning**  
   - Scope: Single‑day event with keynote, 3 breakouts, catering.  
   - Schedule baseline: Deadlines for venue booking, promotion, and registration.  
   - Cost baseline: Budget for venue, marketing, catering; tracked monthly for overruns.

4. **Manufacturing line setup**  
   - WBS: Design, procurement, installation, testing.  
   - Critical path flows through equipment delivery and installation; project manager monitors these most closely.

5. **Waterfall software upgrade**  
   - Requirements and scope defined early; change requests must be evaluated against the **scope baseline** and may require updates to **schedule** and **cost baselines** before approval.

**Day 4 Outcome**: You should now recognize what each baseline contains, how predictive projects structure scope/WBS, and why critical path and time‑phased budgets matter for CAPM questions on planning.
