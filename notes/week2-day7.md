# Day 7 – Predictive Planning: Scope, Schedule, and Cost (Detail)

**Goal**: Deepen Domain II by looking at *how* predictive projects plan **scope, schedule, and cost** using specific processes and outputs [web:141].

---

## 1. Scope Planning in Predictive Projects

Key processes (PMBOK-style thinking):

- **Plan Scope Management** – Defines *how* scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.  
- **Collect Requirements** – Uses techniques like **interviews, workshops, focus groups, surveys, prototypes** to gather stakeholder needs.  
- **Define Scope** – Translates requirements into a detailed **project scope statement** (deliverables, acceptance criteria, exclusions).  
- **Create WBS** – Decomposes project scope into **work packages**, forming the **scope baseline** [web:139].

Outputs to remember:
- **Scope management plan**, **requirements documentation**, **requirements traceability matrix**, **project scope statement**, **WBS**, **WBS dictionary**, **scope baseline**.

## 2. Schedule Planning in Predictive Projects

Key steps:

1. **Define Activities** – Break down work packages into activities.  
2. **Sequence Activities** – Determine logical relationships (FS, SS, FF, SF) and create a **network diagram**.  
3. **Estimate Activity Durations** – Use expert judgment, analogous, parametric, or three‑point estimates.  
4. **Develop Schedule** – Analyze network, identify **critical path**, adjust with leads/lags, resource leveling, and create the **schedule baseline** [web:141].

Outputs:
- **Activity list**, **activity attributes**, **milestone list**, **project schedule network diagrams**, **duration estimates**, **project schedule**, **schedule baseline**.

## 3. Cost Planning in Predictive Projects

Key steps:

- **Plan Cost Management** – Rules for estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs.  
- **Estimate Costs** – Approximate monetary resources needed for activities/work packages (analogous, parametric, bottom‑up, three‑point).  
- **Determine Budget** – Aggregate estimates to create the **cost baseline**, aligning funding and timing [web:141][web:155].

Outputs:
- **Cost management plan**, **cost estimates**, **basis of estimates**, **project budget**, **cost baseline**.

## 4. Integrating Scope, Schedule, and Cost

- The **project management plan** integrates:
  - **Scope baseline** (what work).  
  - **Schedule baseline** (when work).  
  - **Cost baseline** (how much) [web:155].  
- Predictive planning is iterative within planning: refining scope, schedule, and cost until plans are realistic and consistent.

## 5. Exam Triggers (Predictive Planning)

- If a question stresses **detailed upfront planning**, **fixed contracts**, or **regulatory constraints**, think: predictive processes and baselines.  
- If the scenario mentions **change requests** to scope/schedule/cost, look for **formal change control** and updates to baselines when approved [web:141].  
- Terms like **collect requirements, define scope, create WBS, develop schedule, determine budget** are classic predictive planning keywords.
