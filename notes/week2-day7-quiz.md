### Missed Questions & Corrections

1. **Which process primarily produces the project scope statement?**  
   - Correct process: **Define Scope**  
   - Reason: **Collect Requirements** gathers stakeholder needs; **Define Scope** converts those requirements into the detailed **project scope statement** [web:141].

2. **The process that aggregates cost estimates to establish the cost baseline is:**  
   - Correct process: **Determine Budget**  
   - Reason: **Estimate Costs** produces individual cost estimates, while **Determine Budget** aggregates those estimates and funding requirements into the **cost baseline** [web:141][web:155].

### Notes
- Reinforce process–output mapping:
  - **Define Scope → project scope statement → scope baseline (with WBS & WBS dictionary)**.  
  - **Determine Budget → project budget & cost baseline** (time‑phased).
- Add/adjust flashcards for these two processes.
