B. All requirements are fixed by regulation, no change allowed  
C. Some project components have stable requirements while others require experimentation  
D. The organization forbids using more than one approach

### Missed Question & Correction

- **Question:** “Which combination correctly matches baseline to its primary focus?”  
  - **Correct answer:** **Schedule baseline – approved dates and milestones**  
  - **Reason:**  
    - The **schedule baseline** is the approved schedule including start/finish dates and key milestones.  
    - The **scope baseline** focuses on scope (scope statement, WBS, WBS dictionary).  
    - The **cost baseline** is the time‑phased budget used to track cost performance, not dates or risks [web:141][web:155].
