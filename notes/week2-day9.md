# Day 9 – Blending Predictive and Agile (Toward Hybrid Thinking)

**Goal**: Practice deciding when to use **predictive, agile, or hybrid** approaches and how Domain I/II concepts apply in scenarios [web:141].

---

## 1. Predictive vs Agile – Quick Recap

- **Predictive (plan-based)**  
  - **Scope, schedule, cost** defined early; changes tightly controlled.  
  - Best for **stable requirements**, heavy regulatory/contract constraints (e.g., construction, infrastructure) [web:141].

- **Agile / Adaptive**  
  - Short **iterations/increments**, frequent feedback, evolving requirements.  
  - Uses **backlog**, timeboxed events, and continuous stakeholder involvement (e.g., Scrum sprints) [web:141].

- **Hybrid**  
  - Combines predictive and agile elements; e.g., predictive hardware, agile software in same project [web:139].

## 2. Common Exam Cues

- Choose **predictive** when:
  - Requirements are **fixed or stable**, or contract/regulation demands detailed plans.  
  - Changes must go through strict **formal change control**.

- Choose **agile** when:
  - Requirements are **uncertain or changing frequently**.  
  - Stakeholders want **early and continuous delivery** and can give frequent feedback.

- Choose **hybrid** when:
  - Some components are stable; others need experimentation.  
  - Different teams or subsystems benefit from different approaches [web:141].

## 3. Planning Differences

- Predictive planning:
  - Heavy upfront work: **scope baseline, schedule baseline, cost baseline**.  
  - Uses tools like **WBS, network diagrams, critical path, cost baseline** [web:155].

- Agile planning:
  - High-level roadmap + **release planning**, with **detailed planning per iteration**.  
  - Uses **product backlog, sprint backlog, velocity, burndown charts** (high-level awareness for CAPM).

---

## 4. Hybrid Patterns

Examples:
- Predictive for **infrastructure**; agile for user-facing **software**.  
- Predictive **regulatory documentation** with agile **prototype development**.

**Day 9 outcome**: Recognize which approach fits a given scenario and how to spot the cues in CAPM questions.
