1. A construction project is managed predictively with approved scope, schedule, and cost baselines. Early in execution, a key supplier announces a delay that will impact a critical material delivery, threatening the schedule. What should the project manager do FIRST?  
A. Immediately crash all remaining activities  
B. Update only the stakeholder register  
C. Analyze the schedule impact, update the risk/issue logs, and develop response options  
D. Escalate to the sponsor demanding more resources without analysis

2. In an agile software project, the team has delivered three iterations. Stakeholders are happy with progress, but a regulatory body introduces a new compliance requirement that affects several completed features. What is the BEST action?  
A. Refuse to implement the requirement because features were already accepted  
B. Add the new compliance work to the product backlog, discuss impact with stakeholders, and prioritize it for upcoming iterations  
C. Stop the project until all compliance work is completed  
D. Immediately re-open all completed work and implement changes without discussion

3. A hybrid project has a predictive plan for hardware and agile sprints for a user interface. A change request is submitted to add a new UI feature that fits within existing release dates and budget but may impact integration testing effort. What should the project manager do?  
A. Automatically approve the change without any review  
B. Reject the change because it was not part of the original scope baseline  
C. Evaluate integration/testing impact with both teams and, if baselines are not affected, manage it through backlog refinement and coordination  
D. Hand the decision entirely to the agile team with no involvement from the hardware side

4. In a predictive infrastructure project, the project manager notices that risk response plans are not being implemented by team members, and risk reviews have not occurred as scheduled. What is the BEST immediate step?  
A. Ignore it; risks usually resolve themselves  
B. Document the issue and schedule a dedicated risk review meeting to reinforce the risk management plan and responsibilities  
C. Close the risk register and stop tracking risks  
D. Ask team members to work overtime instead

5. In an agile project, velocity has stabilized, but the product owner keeps adding high-priority items, and stakeholders demand more scope in the same time frame. The team is under pressure and morale is dropping. What should the scrum master or team lead do?  
A. Tell the team to work nights and weekends to meet expectations  
B. Hide true velocity to avoid conflict  
C. Facilitate a discussion with the product owner and stakeholders about capacity, using velocity to set realistic expectations and adjust scope  
D. Extend iteration length until all requested work fits

6. A predictive project is halfway through execution when a stakeholder requests additional reporting features. The PM’s analysis shows that accepting the change will increase cost but may improve stakeholder satisfaction and benefits. What is the BEST next step?  
A. Implement the change immediately because it increases benefits  
B. Refuse the change because cost will increase  
C. Submit a change request with the analysis so the appropriate authority can decide  
D. Ask the team to absorb the work without changing budget

7. In a hybrid project, an agile team flags a major risk: integration with the predictive component may fail due to unclear interface specifications. What should the project manager do?  
A. Tell the agile team to proceed and “figure it out later”  
B. Add the risk to the project risk register, involve both teams to clarify interfaces, and plan mitigation actions  
C. Move all work to agile to avoid integration issues  
D. Ignore the risk until testing starts

8. A predictive project is on schedule and on budget, but customer satisfaction scores are low due to usability concerns. Which action is MOST appropriate?  
A. Ignore feedback because the baselines are being met  
B. Revisit requirements and acceptance criteria with stakeholders and explore corrective actions to improve usability  
C. Cut scope to reduce effort  
D. Increase risk reserves

9. In an agile project, the team discovers in a retrospective that last-minute changes near the end of iterations are causing quality defects. What is the BEST adjustment?  
A. Continue the same process; defects will be fixed later  
B. Reduce testing to save time  
C. Improve definition of done and adjust how much work is brought into the sprint so quality can be maintained  
D. Stop doing retrospectives

10. A hybrid project has predictive milestones tied to regulatory submissions and agile teams delivering increments toward those milestones. One agile team wants to shift its focus to an experimental feature that is not required for the next regulatory milestone. What should the project manager do?  
A. Allow the shift without discussion, since agile teams self-organize  
B. Ensure work remains aligned with the upcoming milestone and overall priorities, adjusting backlog focus if necessary  
C. Cancel the milestone  
D. Move all work to the experimental feature and ignore the submission

11. A predictive project experiences repeated misunderstandings with a key stakeholder despite sending detailed status reports. What is the BEST way to improve alignment?  
A. Send even more detailed reports by email  
B. Schedule regular interactive meetings or workshops to clarify expectations, communication preferences, and confirm understanding  
C. Remove the stakeholder from communications  
D. Ask the stakeholder to read the project management plan and stop asking questions

12. In an agile project, a stakeholder complains that they were not consulted on a major design decision that affects their department. What should the project manager or product owner do?  
A. Explain that agile teams do not need stakeholder input once the backlog is defined  
B. Apologize for the oversight, involve them in future discussions, and consider adjusting the backlog if their needs affect value or risk  
C. Ignore the complaint because the decision is already made  
D. Ask them to submit a change request using predictive forms

13. A predictive project is undergoing integrated change control. Multiple approved changes have increased scope and schedule. What is the MOST important thing the PM should ensure after these approvals?  
A. Only that the sponsor is happy  
B. That all related project documents, baselines, and plans are updated and communicated to relevant stakeholders  
C. That the team keeps working as before without distraction  
D. That no further change requests are accepted

14. In a hybrid project, agile teams are delivering increments, but predictive reporting to executives shows only high-level milestone status. Executives feel they lack visibility into real progress. What is the BEST action?  
A. Tell executives to trust the process  
B. Provide integrated reports that connect agile metrics (e.g., completed backlog items, velocity) to milestone and value delivery, tailored to executive needs  
C. Stop agile reporting to avoid confusion  
D. Ask agile teams to switch to Gantt charts only

15. An exam scenario describes: “Baseline plans in place; changes with schedule/cost impact go through a change control board; agile teams adjust backlog within those constraints; regular demos provide feedback, while major decisions follow formal governance.” What approach and key process are MOST emphasized?  
A. Pure predictive and Develop Schedule  
B. Pure agile and Sprint Planning  
C. Hybrid and Perform Integrated Change Control  
D. Informal and Ad hoc issue handling
