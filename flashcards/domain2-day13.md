# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 13 (Mini-Case Scenario Chains)

> Note: Day 13 quiz score – **15/15**. Use these cards to rehearse multi-step scenario logic.

## Predictive Mini-Case Patterns

**1. Predictive Supplier Delay**  
*Front*: In a predictive project, a supplier delay threatens a critical path activity. What is the best first action?  
*Back*: **Analyze schedule impact**, update risk/issue logs, and develop response options (e.g., resequencing, alternatives) before escalating.

**2. Predictive Change with Cost Impact**  
*Front*: Stakeholder requests extra features that increase cost. What should the PM do?  
*Back*: Perform **impact analysis** on scope/schedule/cost/risk and submit a **change request** to the appropriate authority.

**3. After Approved Changes**  
*Front*: Multiple change requests are approved in a predictive project. What must the PM ensure?  
*Back*: All impacted **plans, baselines, and documents** are updated and changes are communicated to relevant stakeholders [web:47][web:52].

## Agile Mini-Case Patterns

**4. New Regulation Affecting Completed Work**  
*Front*: In agile, a new regulatory requirement affects completed features. What is the best action?  
*Back*: Add work to the **product backlog**, discuss impact, and prioritize in upcoming iterations with stakeholders.

**5. Pressure for More Scope with Same Time**  
*Front*: Stable velocity, but stakeholders demand more scope in the same timeframe. What should the team lead do?  
*Back*: Use **velocity** and capacity to set realistic expectations and adjust scope with the product owner and stakeholders.

**6. Quality Drop from Late Changes**  
*Front*: Retrospective reveals that last-minute changes cause defects. What should be adjusted?  
*Back*: Strengthen the **definition of done** and limit how much work is pulled into the sprint to maintain quality.

## Hybrid Mini-Case Patterns

**7. Hybrid – New Feature Without Baseline Impact**  
*Front*: In hybrid, a new agile feature fits time/budget but may affect integration testing. Best approach?  
*Back*: Evaluate integration impacts with both teams; if baselines are intact, handle via **backlog refinement and coordination**.

**8. Hybrid – Integration Risk**  
*Front*: Agile team flags integration risk with predictive component due to unclear interfaces. What should the PM do?  
*Back*: Add it to the **project risk register**, involve both teams to clarify, and plan **mitigation**.

**9. Hybrid – Experimental Feature vs Milestone**  
*Front*: Agile team wants to focus on an experimental feature not needed for the next regulatory milestone. What should PM ensure?  
*Back*: Work stays aligned with **upcoming milestones and priorities**; adjust backlog focus if needed.

## Stakeholders & Communication in Cases

**10. Stakeholder Misunderstandings Despite Reports**  
*Front*: Predictive project has misunderstandings even with detailed reports. What improves alignment?  
*Back*: Hold **interactive meetings/workshops** to clarify expectations and confirm understanding, not just send more documents.

**11. Agile Stakeholder Not Consulted**  
*Front*: Stakeholder complains they were not consulted on a major design decision. What is the best response?  
*Back*: Acknowledge the oversight, involve them in **future discussions**, and adjust backlog if their needs affect value or risk.

**12. Executives Want More Visibility in Hybrid**  
*Front*: Executives see only high-level milestones and want real progress visibility. What should PM provide?  
*Back*: Integrated reports linking **agile metrics** (e.g., completed items, velocity) to milestones and value, tailored to executives.

## Exam Cues & Core Process

**13. Integrated Change Control Cue**  
*Front*: What scenario cues point to **Perform Integrated Change Control**?  
*Back*: References to **baselines**, **change requests**, **CCB**, and decisions about scope/schedule/cost impacts [web:59][web:54].

**14. Mini-Case Chain Thinking**  
*Front*: How should you think through multi-question mini-cases on the exam?  
*Back*: Track what has been **approved**, what risks/issues exist, and which approach is used, then pick the **best next action**, not a one-off reaction [web:42].

**15. Hybrid Governance Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases signal hybrid governance in exam scenarios?  
*Back*: “Baselines and CCB” plus “agile teams adjusting backlog within constraints” and “regular demos with formal governance for major decisions” [web:53].
