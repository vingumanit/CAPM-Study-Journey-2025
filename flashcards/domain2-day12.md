# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 12 (Integrated Scenario Thinking)

> Note: Day 12 quiz score – **15/15**. Use these cards to drill “best next action” thinking across mixed scenarios.

## Integrated Change Control

**1. When to Use Integrated Change Control**  
*Front*: In integrated scenarios, when should **formal integrated change control** be used?  
*Back*: Whenever a proposed change may impact **scope, schedule, or cost baselines**, the PM should analyze impacts and submit a **change request** for decision [web:48][web:52].

**2. Key Steps in Integrated Change Control**  
*Front*: What are typical steps of **integrated change control**?  
*Back*: Identify and document the change, analyze impact across constraints, get appropriate approval (e.g., CCB), then update **plans, baselines, and documents** as needed [web:50][web:51].

**3. Change vs Issue vs Risk**  
*Front*: How do change requests differ from issues and risks in scenario questions?  
*Back*: **Risks** are uncertain events, **issues** are current problems, **changes** are proposed modifications that may impact approved **baselines**.

## Predictive Scenario Actions

**4. Predictive – Scope Increase Request**  
*Front*: In predictive, a stakeholder requests additional scope that affects time and cost. What is usually the **best first step**?  
*Back*: **Analyze impact** on scope, schedule, cost, and risk, then **submit a change request** instead of implementing immediately.

**5. Predictive – High-Risk Item Early**  
*Front*: In planning, a high-probability, high-impact risk is identified. What should the PM do?  
*Back*: Document it in the **risk register**, analyze it, and define **response strategies** and reserves as needed.

**6. Predictive – Sponsor Wants Faster Delivery**  
*Front*: Sponsor pushes to crash schedule with no extra budget. What is the best response?  
*Back*: Explain options and trade-offs; analyze impact on **cost, risk, and quality** before agreeing to changes.

## Agile & Hybrid Scenario Actions

**7. Agile – Complex, Risky Feature**  
*Front*: In agile, a feature is more complex and risky than expected. How should the team respond?  
*Back*: Discuss in team events, break into **smaller items or a spike**, and re-plan in upcoming iterations while managing risk via backlog.

**8. Agile – Missed Sprint Goals**  
*Front*: An agile team overcommits and misses sprint goals frequently. What corrective action is best?  
*Back*: Use **past velocity** and better estimation to commit realistically during sprint planning.

**9. Hybrid – Regulatory Change**  
*Front*: In hybrid, a regulatory change affects both predictive and agile components. What should the PM do?  
*Back*: Perform **integrated impact analysis** and submit a **change request** for schedule/cost as needed, coordinating both sides.

## Stakeholders & Communication

**10. Agile Stakeholder Not Attending Reviews**  
*Front*: In agile, a stakeholder misses reviews and is surprised by product direction. What should be done?  
*Back*: Work with them to adjust **meeting times/formats**, clarify expectations, and stress the importance of **regular feedback**.

**11. Predictive Stakeholder Upset About Rejected Change**  
*Front*: In predictive, stakeholder upset that CCB rejected a change. Best PM response?  
*Back*: Explain the **change control process**, share **impact analysis**, and explore alternatives or future requests.

**12. Integrated Status Reporting**  
*Front*: In predictive, stakeholder wants a detailed status. What should the PM provide?  
*Back*: A clear report integrating **schedule, cost, and risk** information tailored to that stakeholder’s needs.

## Exam Cues & Approach Identification

**13. Pure Predictive Exam Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases signal **pure predictive** in integrated scenarios?  
*Back*: “Detailed upfront planning,” “baselines approved,” “change control board,” **phase gates**, formal reports [web:45][web:54].

**14. Pure Agile Exam Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases signal **pure agile**?  
*Back*: “Sprints,” “product backlog,” “frequent demos,” “retrospectives,” **continuous stakeholder feedback**.

**15. Hybrid Exam Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases signal a **hybrid** approach?  
*Back*: “Detailed baselines + change control board” combined with “components delivered in **sprints** with frequent feedback,” or predictive infrastructure plus agile software [web:5][web:53].
