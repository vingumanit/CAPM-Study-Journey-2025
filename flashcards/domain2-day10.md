# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 10 (Hybrid Planning & Baselines)

## Hybrid + Baselines

**1. Hybrid Use of Baselines**  
*Front*: How are **baselines** used in hybrid projects?  
*Back*: They control overall **scope, schedule, and cost**, while some teams deliver using agile methods inside those boundaries [web:7][web:9].

**2. Formal Change Control Trigger**  
*Front*: When is **formal change control** required in a hybrid project?  
*Back*: When a change impacts approved **scope, schedule, or cost baselines**, regardless of whether delivery is predictive or agile [web:7][web:10].

**3. Backlog vs Baseline**  
*Front*: How does a **product backlog** differ from a **scope baseline**?  
*Back*: Scope baseline is an **approved scope reference**; product backlog is a **prioritized, evolving list** of work items.

## Agile Inside Predictive Guardrails

**4. Agile Teams in Hybrid**  
*Front*: How do agile teams operate within a hybrid project?  
*Back*: They plan **iterations/sprints** and adjust backlog items, but must respect overall **time and budget baselines**.

**5. Backlog Changes**  
*Front*: Do all backlog changes require baseline updates?  
*Back*: No; backlog can change as long as changes stay within approved **scope, schedule, and cost** limits.

**6. Re‑baselining**  
*Front*: When might **re‑baselining** be appropriate in a hybrid project?  
*Back*: When significant approved changes make the original baselines unrealistic; done via **formal change control**, not informally [web:7].

## Exam Cues – Hybrid vs Pure Approaches

**7. Hybrid Cue – Mixed Methods**  
*Front*: What scenario strongly signals a **hybrid** approach?  
*Back*: Predictive planning for **construction/procurement** plus agile sprints for **software/features** under one governance framework [web:5][web:9].

**8. Pure Predictive Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases often indicate **pure predictive**?  
*Back*: **Fixed scope**, detailed upfront plan, strict contract terms, **heavy regulation**, and emphasis on baselines.

**9. Pure Agile Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases often indicate **pure agile**?  
*Back*: **Evolving requirements**, product backlog, short iterations, frequent demos, and continuous stakeholder feedback [web:5][web:8].

## Artifacts & Roles

**10. Product Backlog Role**  
*Front*: What is the role of the **product backlog** in hybrid projects?  
*Back*: It captures and prioritizes work for agile teams while still aligning with overall project baselines.

**11. Scope Baseline Contents**  
*Front*: What are the main components of the **scope baseline**?  
*Back*: The **scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary** (still used in hybrid for predictive parts).

**12. Schedule Baseline Role**  
*Front*: How is the **schedule baseline** used in hybrid projects?  
*Back*: To define **key milestones and dates** that agile teams should align their iterations and releases with [web:7].

## Governance & Alignment

**13. Governance in Hybrid**  
*Front*: Why is governance important in hybrid projects?  
*Back*: To coordinate predictive and agile parts so **dependencies, risks, and value delivery** stay aligned [web:9].

**14. Aligning Sprints to Milestones**  
*Front*: How should sprints align with predictive milestones?  
*Back*: Sprints should be planned so **increments are ready** for major milestones and reviews defined in the schedule baseline.

**15. Change Example**  
*Front*: In hybrid, a new request extends duration beyond the schedule baseline. What must happen?  
*Back*: PM analyzes impact and raises a **change request** to update the schedule baseline through formal change control [web:7][web:10].

**16. Phase-Based Hybrid Example**  
*Front*: A project uses agile for early requirements discovery, then locks down scope and follows a predictive plan for deployment. What type of life cycle is this, and why?  
*Back*: It is a **hybrid** life cycle because early phases use **agile/adaptive** practices to explore requirements, followed by a **predictive** phase for structured deployment and rollout within fixed scope, schedule, and cost constraints [web:11][web:14][web:6].
