# CAPM Domain I Flashcards – Day 4 (Predictive Planning)

## Scope, WBS, Schedule, Cost & Baselines

**1. Project Scope**  
*Definition*: The work performed to deliver specified **products, services, or results** with the required features and functions. [web:141]  
*Example*: “Build a 3‑bedroom house with 2 bathrooms and a garage.”

**2. Scope Statement**  
*Definition*: A detailed narrative description of the **project scope**, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. It does **not** include detailed activity dates. [web:141]  
*Example*: Lists what is in/out of the house project, plus constraints like lot size.

**3. WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**  
*Definition*: A **hierarchical decomposition** of the total project work into smaller, manageable components called **work packages**. [web:139]  
*Example*: Level 1 “House”, Level 2 “Foundation / Framing / Roofing”.

**4. Work Package**  
*Definition*: The lowest level in the WBS where cost and duration can be reliably estimated. [web:139]  
*Example*: “Install roof trusses” as a single work package.

**5. Scope Baseline**  
*Definition*: The approved combination of **scope statement**, **WBS**, and **WBS dictionary**. [web:141]  
*Use*: Basis for controlling scope changes.

**6. Activity**  
*Definition*: A specific **scheduled piece of work** that must be performed to produce a deliverable.  
*Example*: “Pour concrete for foundation.”

**7. Sequencing Activities**  
*Definition*: Determining the logical **order and dependencies** among activities (FS, SS, FF, SF). [web:139]  
*Example*: “Pour foundation” must finish before “Start framing.”

**8. Network Diagram**  
*Definition*: A graphical representation of activities and their dependencies.  
*Use*: Used to find the **critical path**.

**9. Critical Path**  
*Definition*: The **longest path** through the network with **zero total float**, determining the shortest possible project duration. [web:141]  
*Consequence*: Delay on critical path = delay of project (if unchanged).

**10. Float (Slack)**  
*Definition*: The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date or a successor.  
*Example*: Non‑critical activities often have positive float.

**11. Schedule Baseline**  
*Definition*: The **approved version of the project schedule**, including planned start/finish dates, used to measure schedule performance. [web:155]  
*Use*: Compare actual vs planned dates.

**12. Cost Estimate**  
*Definition*: An approximation of the **monetary resources** needed to complete activities, work packages, or the whole project. [web:141]  
*Types*: Rough order of magnitude, budget, definitive.

**13. Cost Baseline**  
*Definition*: The **time‑phased, approved budget** for the project, excluding management reserves; often shown as an **S‑curve**. [web:155]  
*Use*: Basis for Earned Value Management (EVM).

**14. Predictive Life Cycle**  
*Definition*: A life cycle where **scope, schedule, and cost** are determined early and changes are carefully controlled. [web:141]  
*Example*: Highway construction.

**15. Change Control**  
*Definition*: A formal process to evaluate and approve/reject requested changes to **scope, schedule, or cost baselines**.  
*Example*: Change Control Board (CCB) reviews a new feature request.

**16. Baseline vs Plan**  
*Definition*: A **plan** is draft; a **baseline** is the **approved plan** used for performance measurement.  
*Example*: Schedule becomes schedule baseline after sponsor approval.

**17. Rolling Wave Planning**  
*Definition*: Planning in **progressive detail**; near‑term work is detailed, future work is higher level. [web:141]  
*Use*: Still compatible with predictive when high‑level scope is stable.

**18. Top‑Down Estimating**  
*Definition*: Estimating based on overall project or similar past projects (analogous/parametric).  
*Use*: Early in planning when details are limited.

**19. Bottom‑Up Estimating**  
*Definition*: Estimating by aggregating estimates of individual **activities or work packages**.  
*Use*: Later in planning when WBS is complete.

**20. Performance Measurement**  
*Definition*: Comparing **actual** scope, schedule, and cost to corresponding **baselines** to determine variances. [web:155]  
*Example*: Schedule variance, cost variance in EVM.
