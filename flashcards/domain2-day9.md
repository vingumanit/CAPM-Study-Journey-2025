# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 9 (Predictive vs Agile vs Hybrid)

## Approaches Overview

**1. Predictive Approach – Key Traits**  
*Front*: What are key traits of a **predictive** (plan-based) approach?  
*Back*: **Scope, schedule, and cost** defined early, heavy upfront planning, strong use of **baselines** and formal change control; best when **requirements are stable** [web:141].

**2. Agile/Adaptive Approach – Key Traits**  
*Front*: What are key traits of an **agile/adaptive** approach?  
*Back*: **Short iterations/increments**, evolving requirements, continuous stakeholder feedback, and frequent delivery of **working product** [web:141].

**3. Hybrid Approach – Definition**  
*Front*: What is a **hybrid** approach?  
*Back*: A combination where some project components use **predictive** methods and others use **agile**, coordinated under one governance framework [web:139].

## When to Use Which

**4. Predictive – When to Choose**  
*Front*: When is **predictive** usually the best choice?  
*Back*: When requirements are **stable, regulated, and well understood** and contracts or compliance demand detailed upfront plans [web:141].

**5. Agile – When to Choose**  
*Front*: When is **agile/adaptive** usually the best choice?  
*Back*: When requirements are **uncertain or likely to change**, and stakeholders can provide **frequent feedback**.

**6. Hybrid – When to Choose**  
*Front*: When is a **hybrid** lifecycle most appropriate?  
*Back*: When some parts of the project are **stable** and others require **experimentation** (e.g., predictive infrastructure + agile software).

## Planning Differences

**7. Predictive Planning**  
*Front*: How does planning typically work in **predictive** projects?  
*Back*: Heavy **upfront planning**, creating **scope, schedule, and cost baselines** (WBS, network diagrams, critical path, cost baseline).

**8. Agile Planning**  
*Front*: How does planning typically work in **agile** projects?  
*Back*: High‑level **product roadmap**, then **detailed planning each iteration** using backlogs and short planning sessions.

**9. Product Backlog**  
*Front*: What is a **product backlog**?  
*Back*: A **prioritized list of features and requirements** owned by the product owner, used to plan agile iterations.

## Change Handling

**10. Change in Predictive**  
*Front*: How is change handled in **predictive** approaches?  
*Back*: Mainly through **formal change control** against approved **scope, schedule, and cost baselines**.

**11. Change in Agile**  
*Front*: How is change handled in **agile** approaches?  
*Back*: Change is expected; handled through **backlog refinement**, reprioritization, and adjustments between iterations.

## Scenario Cues (Exam)

**12. Predictive Cue**  
*Front*: On the exam, what do “**fixed contract**, **regulatory requirements**, **detailed upfront plan**” usually signal?  
*Back*: A **predictive/plan-based** approach is most appropriate.

**13. Agile Cue**  
*Front*: What do “**short iterations**, **evolving requirements**, **frequent demos**” signal?  
*Back*: An **agile/adaptive** approach.

**14. Hybrid Cue**  
*Front*: What do “**predictive for infrastructure**, **agile for user-facing features**” suggest?  
*Back*: A **hybrid** lifecycle.

## Events & Artifacts

**15. Iterations/Sprints**  
*Front*: What are **iterations/sprints** in agile?  
*Back*: **Timeboxed cycles** (often 1–4 weeks) where a cross‑functional team delivers a potentially usable increment and inspects/adapts.

**16. Review & Retrospective**  
*Front*: What is the purpose of **reviews and retrospectives** in agile?  
*Back*: **Reviews** inspect the product with stakeholders; **retrospectives** inspect the process and team performance for improvement.

**17. Baselines vs Backlogs**  
*Front*: How do **baselines** differ from **backlogs**?  
*Back*: **Baselines** are approved reference plans (predictive); **backlogs** are **ordered lists of work** that evolve over time (agile).

## Hybrid Examples

**18. Hybrid Example – Factory + Software**  
*Front*: Give a hybrid example combining predictive and agile.  
*Back*: Use **predictive** methods for constructing a factory building and **agile** sprints for developing the control software.

**19. Hybrid Example – Platform + AI Features**  
*Front*: How might a hybrid approach work for a stable platform plus experimental AI features?  
*Back*: **Predictive** for core platform (stable requirements); **agile** for AI features (evolving requirements).

**20. Governance in Hybrid**  
*Front*: What is important for governance in a hybrid project?  
*Back*: Coordinating both predictive and agile parts under a **single overarching governance structure** so dependencies, risks, and value delivery stay aligned.
