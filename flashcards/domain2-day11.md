# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 11 (Risk & Stakeholders Across Approaches)

> Note: Day 11 quiz score – **15/15**. Use these cards for quick refresh before mixed risk/stakeholder questions.

## Predictive Risk Management

**1. Predictive – When Are Risks Identified?**  
*Front*: When is most risk identification and analysis done in predictive projects?  
*Back*: Mostly during **early planning**, creating a **risk register** and planned responses, then monitoring and updating during execution [web:23].

**2. Risk Register Purpose**  
*Front*: What is the **risk register** used for?  
*Back*: To record identified risks, causes, probability/impact, owners, and planned responses for ongoing monitoring and control.

**3. Formal Change Control & Risk**  
*Front*: When do risk-related changes typically require **formal change control** in predictive projects?  
*Back*: When implementing a response will **impact approved scope, schedule, or cost baselines**, triggering formal evaluation and approval [web:21].

## Agile Risk Management

**4. Agile – How Is Risk Managed?**  
*Front*: How is risk management integrated into agile projects?  
*Back*: As a **continuous activity** each iteration via backlog refinement, planning, reviews, and retrospectives, with small increments reducing exposure [web:22][web:24].

**5. Agile Events and Risk**  
*Front*: Which agile event primarily focuses on **process improvement and learning from issues/risks**?  
*Back*: The **retrospective**, where the team inspects what went well or badly and adapts its way of working.

**6. Risks and the Backlog**  
*Front*: How do agile teams often handle risks in their planning?  
*Back*: By reflecting risk-related work as **backlog items** or priorities, scheduling mitigation or spike work in upcoming iterations [web:24].

## Stakeholder Engagement – Predictive vs Agile

**7. Predictive Stakeholder Pattern**  
*Front*: What is the typical pattern of stakeholder engagement in predictive life cycles?  
*Back*: High involvement during **initiation/planning** and at **major reviews or phase gates**, with more formal, periodic communication in between [web:21].

**8. Agile Stakeholder Pattern**  
*Front*: How are stakeholders typically engaged in agile life cycles?  
*Back*: Through **frequent collaboration**, reviews/demos each iteration, and ongoing feedback that shapes the backlog and priorities [web:21][web:39].

**9. Misaligned Expectations Lesson**  
*Front*: In a predictive project, scope is delivered but stakeholders are dissatisfied. What key lesson should be applied?  
*Back*: Engage stakeholders more **frequently**, validate requirements, and manage expectations via better communication and involvement.

## Hybrid Risk & Stakeholder Patterns

**10. Hybrid Risk Handling**  
*Front*: How is risk commonly managed in hybrid projects?  
*Back*: With an overall **project-level risk register and plan**, while agile teams identify and mitigate risks in sprints and escalate significant ones [web:29][web:39].

**11. Hybrid Stakeholder Engagement**  
*Front*: How does stakeholder engagement often look in hybrid projects?  
*Back*: Formal sponsor reviews at major milestones plus agile-style **demos and reviews** for user groups throughout delivery [web:39].

**12. Formal Change vs Backlog Change**  
*Front*: In a hybrid project, what kind of change should trigger **formal change control** instead of just backlog reprioritization?  
*Back*: Changes that will **impact approved schedule or cost baselines**, not just the order of items within existing constraints [web:21].

## Exam Cues & Actions

**13. Predictive Exam Cue**  
*Front*: On the exam, what phrases suggest a **predictive** approach for risk and stakeholders?  
*Back*: “Most risks documented up front,” “phase gates,” “change control board,” and formal reports at scheduled intervals [web:21][web:23].

**14. Agile Exam Cue**  
*Front*: What phrases suggest an **agile** approach for risk and stakeholders?  
*Back*: “Frequent demos,” “regular retrospectives,” “continuous stakeholder collaboration,” and “backlog refinement each iteration” [web:24][web:38].

**15. Best First Action – Agile Risk**  
*Front*: In agile, a new risk threatens the next release. What is often the **best first action**?  
*Back*: Raise it in **team events** (standup/planning), adjust backlog priorities, and plan mitigation work in upcoming iterations.
