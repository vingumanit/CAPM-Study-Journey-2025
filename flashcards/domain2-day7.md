# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 7 (Predictive Planning Detail)

## Scope Planning

**1. Plan Scope Management**  
*Front*: What is the purpose of **Plan Scope Management**?  
*Back*: To define **how project and product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled**, resulting in the **scope management plan**.

**2. Collect Requirements**  
*Front*: What is the main goal of **Collect Requirements**?  
*Back*: To **document stakeholder needs and expectations** using tools like interviews, workshops, surveys, and prototypes, producing **requirements documentation** and a **requirements traceability matrix** [web:141].

**3. Define Scope – Output**  
*Front*: Which process primarily produces the **project scope statement**?  
*Back*: **Define Scope** – it converts the gathered requirements into the detailed **project scope statement** (deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, constraints, exclusions) that later becomes part of the **scope baseline** [web:141].

**4. Create WBS**  
*Front*: What does **Create WBS** achieve?  
*Back*: It decomposes project scope into **work packages** and, along with the scope statement and WBS dictionary, forms the **scope baseline** [web:139].

**5. Scope Baseline Components**  
*Front*: What three components form the **scope baseline**?  
*Back*: **Scope statement**, **WBS**, and **WBS dictionary**.

## Schedule Planning

**6. Define Activities**  
*Front*: What is the output of **Define Activities**?  
*Back*: An **activity list**, activity attributes, and a milestone list, describing all the activities needed to produce project deliverables.

**7. Sequence Activities**  
*Front*: What is done in **Sequence Activities**?  
*Back*: Activities are **ordered and linked** using logical relationships (FS, SS, FF, SF) to create **schedule network diagrams**.

**8. Develop Schedule**  
*Front*: Which process identifies the **critical path**?  
*Back*: **Develop Schedule** – it analyzes sequences, durations, and dependencies to build the schedule and find the **critical path** [web:141].

**9. Schedule Baseline**  
*Front*: What is the **schedule baseline**?  
*Back*: The **approved version of the project schedule** with start/finish dates and milestones, used to measure **schedule performance** [web:155].

## Cost Planning

**10. Plan Cost Management**  
*Front*: What does **Plan Cost Management** define?  
*Back*: The **policies, procedures, and guidelines** for planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling project costs.

**11. Estimate Costs**  
*Front*: What happens in **Estimate Costs**?  
*Back*: The team **approximates the monetary resources** needed for activities/work packages, producing **cost estimates** and a **basis of estimates** [web:141].

**12. Determine Budget – Output**  
*Front*: Which process aggregates cost estimates to establish the **cost baseline**?  
*Back*: **Determine Budget** – it aggregates cost estimates and funding requirements to create the **project budget** and the **cost baseline** [web:141][web:155].

**13. Cost Baseline**  
*Front*: What is the **cost baseline**?  
*Back*: The **time-phased, approved budget** (excluding management reserves) used to track cost performance and support earned value analysis [web:155].

## Estimating Techniques & Integration

**14. Analogous Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **analogous (top‑down) estimating**?  
*Back*: Using **data from similar past projects** to quickly estimate costs or durations at a high level.

**15. Bottom-Up Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **bottom‑up estimating**?  
*Back*: Estimating individual **activities or work packages** and aggregating them to develop detailed project estimates.

**16. Parametric Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **parametric estimating**?  
*Back*: Using a **unit rate** (e.g., cost per meter, hours per feature) multiplied by quantity to estimate cost or duration.

**17. Rolling Wave Planning**  
*Front*: How does **rolling wave planning** apply in predictive projects?  
*Back*: It plans **near-term work in detail** and **future work at a higher level**, adding detail as more information becomes available.

## Change Control & Exam Triggers

**18. Change Requests & Baselines**  
*Front*: How should changes affecting scope, schedule, or cost be handled?  
*Back*: Through **formal change control**—analyze impact, seek approval, and **update baselines and plans** if the change is approved [web:141].

**19. Predictive Planning Exam Cue**  
*Front*: On the exam, what do phrases like “**detailed upfront planning**” and “**fixed contract with defined requirements**” suggest?  
*Back*: That a **predictive, plan-based approach** with strong baselines is most appropriate.

**20. Integrating Scope, Schedule, Cost**  
*Front*: Where are scope, schedule, and cost baselines integrated?  
*Back*: In the **project management plan**, which coordinates how these baselines are used to execute, monitor, and control the project [web:141][web:155].
