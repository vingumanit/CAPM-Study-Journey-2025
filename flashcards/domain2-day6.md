# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 6 (Predictive Overview)

## Predictive / Plan-Based Basics

**1. Domain II Focus**  
*Front*: What is the main focus of **Domain II** in the CAPM exam?  
*Back*: **Predictive / plan-based project management approaches**—how scope, schedule, and cost are planned and controlled using detailed plans and baselines [web:141].

**2. Predictive Approach – When to Use**  
*Front*: When is a **predictive** approach most appropriate?  
*Back*: When **requirements are stable, well-understood, and constrained by regulation or contract**, and tight control of scope, schedule, and cost is needed [web:141].

**3. Project Phase**  
*Front*: What is a **project phase** in predictive work?  
*Back*: A collection of related project activities (e.g., **concept, design, build, test**) that results in one or more deliverables and usually ends with a review or phase gate.

**4. Process Groups per Phase**  
*Front*: How do **process groups** relate to phases in predictive projects?  
*Back*: Each phase can go through all **five process groups**: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, and closing [web:139].

## Roles in Predictive Projects

**5. PM Role in Predictive**  
*Front*: What is a key responsibility of the **project manager** in predictive approaches?  
*Back*: To **integrate and manage the project management plan and baselines**, and to oversee **formal change control** when scope, schedule, or cost changes are requested [web:141].

**6. Sponsor Role**  
*Front*: What does the **sponsor** typically do in predictive projects?  
*Back*: **Authorizes** the project (charter), approves major plans and changes that significantly impact **scope, time, or cost**, and provides funding and support.

**7. Functional Manager Role**  
*Front*: How do **functional managers** contribute to predictive projects?  
*Back*: They provide **resources and subject-matter expertise**, help with estimating, and often manage team members’ line responsibilities.

## Project Management Plan & Artifacts

**8. Project Management Plan – Definition**  
*Front*: What is the **project management plan** in a predictive project?  
*Back*: An **integrated document** consolidating subsidiary management plans (scope, schedule, cost, quality, etc.) and **baselines** that guide project execution and control [web:141].

**9. Project Management Plan – Purpose**  
*Front*: What is the main purpose of the **project management plan**?  
*Back*: To describe **how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed**, and how the various plans fit together.

**10. Subsidiary Plans Examples**  
*Front*: Name three examples of **subsidiary management plans** inside the project management plan.  
*Back*: Examples: **Scope management plan, schedule management plan, cost management plan, risk management plan, communications plan, stakeholder engagement plan**, etc.

## Baselines & Change Control

**11. Scope Baseline – Focus**  
*Front*: What is the focus of the **scope baseline**?  
*Back*: Defines **what work is included** in the project via the **scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary**.

**12. Schedule Baseline – Focus**  
*Front*: What is the primary focus of the **schedule baseline**?  
*Back*: The **approved project dates and milestones** used to measure schedule performance [web:155].

**13. Cost Baseline – Focus**  
*Front*: What does the **cost baseline** represent?  
*Back*: The **time-phased, approved budget** (excluding management reserves) against which actual costs are compared [web:155].

**14. Change Request Impact**  
*Front*: What should happen when a change request affects scope, schedule, or cost?  
*Back*: It should be **documented, analyzed, and processed through formal change control**, potentially updating baselines if approved [web:141].

## Predictive Strengths & Trade-Offs

**15. Strength of Predictive Approaches**  
*Front*: What is a key strength of **predictive** approaches?  
*Back*: Strong **upfront planning and control** of scope, time, and cost through detailed plans and baselines—useful in regulated or contract-driven environments [web:141].

**16. Predictive vs Agile – Requirements**  
*Front*: How do **requirements** differ between predictive and agile?  
*Back*: Predictive assumes **stable requirements** defined early; agile assumes requirements **evolve and change frequently** [web:141].

**17. Predictive vs Agile – Change Handling**  
*Front*: How is **change** typically handled differently in predictive vs agile?  
*Back*: Predictive uses **formal change control** against baselines; agile uses **iterative planning and backlog refinement** to absorb change more naturally.

## Example Scenarios

**18. Construction Project – Approach**  
*Front*: A highway project with strict regulatory specs and fixed deadlines. Which approach fits best?  
*Back*: A primarily **predictive** approach with detailed upfront planning and controlled changes.

**19. Mixed Hardware & Software – Approach**  
*Front*: A physical device is stable, but its app needs experimentation. Which lifecycle fits best?  
*Back*: A **hybrid** approach: predictive for hardware, agile for software components.

**20. Exam Trigger – “Stable Requirements”**  
*Front*: On the CAPM exam, what should you think when a scenario emphasizes **stable, regulated, fully defined requirements**?  
*Back*: It is a cue that a **predictive / plan-based approach** and strong reliance on **baselines** is likely the best answer [web:141].
