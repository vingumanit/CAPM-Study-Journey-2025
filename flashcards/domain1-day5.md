## Lifecycles

**8. Predictive Lifecycle – When to Use**  
*Front*: When is a **predictive lifecycle** most appropriate?  
*Back*: When **requirements are stable and well-understood early**, and change is limited.

**9. Agile/Adaptive Lifecycle – Key Trait**  
*Front*: What is a key characteristic of an **agile/adaptive lifecycle**?  
*Back*: **Frequent iterations and feedback**, expecting and welcoming **changing requirements**.

**10. Hybrid Lifecycle – Example**  
*Front*: Give an example of a **hybrid** lifecycle.  
*Back*: Using **predictive** methods for construction and **agile** sprints for software components in the same project.

## Scope, WBS, and Scope Baseline

**11. Project Scope vs Product Scope**  
*Front*: How does **project scope** differ from **product scope**?  
*Back*: Project scope = **work** to deliver the product; product scope = **features and functions** of the product itself.

**12. WBS Purpose**  
*Front*: What is the primary purpose of the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**?  
*Back*: To **decompose total project work** into smaller, manageable **work packages**.

**13. Scope Baseline – Components**  
*Front*: What three elements form the **scope baseline**?  
*Back*: **Scope statement**, **WBS**, and **WBS dictionary**.

## Schedule & Cost Baselines

**14. Schedule Baseline – Focus**  
*Front*: What does the **schedule baseline** primarily capture?  
*Back*: The **approved project schedule**, including **start/finish dates and milestones** used to measure schedule performance [web:155].

**15. Cost Baseline – Focus**  
*Front*: What does the **cost baseline** represent?  
*Back*: The **time‑phased, approved budget** (excluding management reserves) used to track **cost performance** over time.

**16. Critical Path – Definition**  
*Front*: What is the **critical path**?  
*Back*: The **longest path** through the schedule network with **zero total float**, determining the **shortest possible project duration**.

**17. Float (Slack)**  
*Front*: What is **float (slack)** in scheduling?  
*Back*: The amount of time an activity can be delayed **without delaying** the project’s finish date (for total float).

## Estimating & Planning Techniques

**18. Analogous (Top‑Down) Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **analogous estimating**?  
*Back*: A **top‑down** technique using data from **similar past projects** to estimate costs or durations quickly.

**19. Bottom‑Up Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **bottom‑up estimating**?  
*Back*: Estimating individual **activities or work packages** and aggregating them to develop project estimates.

**20. Rolling Wave Planning**  
*Front*: What is **rolling wave planning** in predictive projects?  
*Back*: Planning **near‑term work in detail** and **future work at a higher level**, refining plans as more information becomes available.
