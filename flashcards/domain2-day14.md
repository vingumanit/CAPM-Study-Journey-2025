# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 14 (Mixed-Domain Timed Block)

> Note: Day 14 quiz score – **13/15**. Flashcards emphasize schedule processes and RTM.

## Schedule Processes – Where Work Fits

**1. Define vs Sequence vs Develop Schedule**  
*Front*: How do **Define Activities**, **Sequence Activities**, and **Develop Schedule** differ?  
*Back*: Define Activities = identify and document **activities**; Sequence Activities = order them and define **dependencies**; Develop Schedule = combine **durations, dependencies, and constraints** into a full schedule model and baseline.[web:73][web:75]

**2. Develop Schedule – Key Inputs and Actions**  
*Front*: What happens in **Develop Schedule**?  
*Back*: The PM uses activity list, durations, dependencies, resources, and constraints to create the **project schedule**, analyze critical path, and establish the **schedule baseline**.[web:73][web:76]

**3. Exam Cue for Develop Schedule**  
*Front*: What phrases in questions often point to **Develop Schedule**?  
*Back*: “Estimating or finalizing activity durations,” “identifying dependencies and building the schedule,” “critical path analysis,” “creating the schedule baseline.”[web:73][web:78]

## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

**4. RTM – Core Purpose**  
*Front*: What is the main purpose of the **requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**?  
*Back*: To **track each requirement** from origin through design, build, and testing, linking it to deliverables and test cases so nothing is missed.[web:77][web:79]

**5. RTM – When to Use It on the Exam**  
*Front*: When exam scenarios ask how to ensure every requirement is designed, built, and tested, what artifact should you think of?  
*Back*: The **RTM** – it shows bidirectional traceability from requirements to work products and tests.

**6. RTM vs WBS vs Scope Statement**  
*Front*: How does the RTM differ from the **WBS** and **scope statement**?  
*Back*: Scope statement describes overall **scope**; WBS decomposes work; **RTM** links individual **requirements** to design, work, and tests across the lifecycle.[web:79][web:81]

## Mixed-Domain Exam Habits

**7. Using Artifacts to Decode Questions**  
*Front*: How can artifacts help you decode mixed-domain questions quickly?  
*Back*: Identify whether the situation points to **schedule artifacts** (network/schedule), **requirements artifacts** (RTM, docs), or **agile artifacts** (backlog, DoD) to pinpoint the right process or action.[web:70]

**8. Close-Choice Strategy**  
*Front*: When two answers look good, what tie-breaker should you use?  
*Back*: Prefer the one that **analyzes first**, uses the **correct artifact/process**, and respects governance (e.g., change control) over quick, informal action.[web:68][web:70]

**9. Hybrid Scenario Cue**  
*Front*: In mixed-domain questions, what often signals a **hybrid** approach?  
*Back*: Predictive **baselines and CCB** plus agile **sprints/backlog** and demos, with integrated change control for scope/schedule/cost impacts.[web:68][web:53]

## Agile & BA Reinforcements

**10. Velocity for Forecasting**  
*Front*: How should stable **velocity** be used for an upcoming release commitment?  
*Back*: Use past velocity to **forecast realistic scope** by the target date, instead of promising all requested items.

**11. Definition of Done (DoD)**  
*Front*: What does the **definition of done** provide in agile?  
*Back*: A shared understanding of when a backlog item is **complete and acceptable**, supporting consistent quality.

**12. Early BA Work**  
*Front*: In early BA work before solution selection, what artifact/activities are key?  
*Back*: **Requirements documentation** and techniques like **interviews, workshops, and brainstorming** to capture stakeholder needs.[web:63]

## Communication & Stakeholders

**13. Tailoring Communications**  
*Front*: How should a PM respond when a stakeholder wants less technical detail and more summary?  
*Back*: **Tailor communications**: provide higher-level status, key risks, and clear summaries in a format that fits their needs.

**14. Agile Interruptions Mid-Sprint**  
*Front*: How should ad hoc stakeholder requests be handled in agile to protect focus?  
*Back*: Route requests through the **product owner and backlog refinement**, not directly to the team during an active sprint.

**15. Value-Improving Change with Cost/Time Impact**  
*Front*: In predictive, a change improves value but increases cost/time. What is the best next step?  
*Back*: Perform **impact analysis** and submit a **change request** to the appropriate authority instead of implementing informally.
