## **Flashcard 1**
**Q:** What is the defining characteristic of the **Predictive** life cycle?  
**A:** Requirements are fully defined upfront and work proceeds sequentially.

---

## **Flashcard 2**

---

## **Flashcard 4**
**Q:** What two types of development does **Agile** combine?  
**A:** Iterative + Incremental.

---

## **Flashcard 5**
**Q:** Which life cycle mixes predictive for stable parts and agile for evolving parts?  
**A:** **Hybrid** life cycle.

---

## **Flashcard 6**
**Q:** Define **Tailoring**.  
**A:** Adapting PM methods, processes, and tools to fit the project context.

---

## **Flashcard 7**
**Q:** Which life cycle is best when requirements are highly uncertain?  
**A:** **Agile**.

---

## **Flashcard 8**
**Q:** Which life cycle is best for large construction projects?

---

## **Flashcard 9**
**Q:** Delivering an MVP first is an example of which approach?  
**A:** **Agile** (iterative + incremental).

---

## **Flashcard 10**
**Q:** What is the main purpose of tailoring in PMBOK 7?

---

## **Flashcard 11**
**Q:** What type of delivery does Incremental provide?  
**A:** Multiple **usable increments** of the product.

---

## **Flashcard 12**
**Q:** When is a Hybrid life cycle most appropriate?  
**A:** When parts of the project have stable requirements while others are uncertain.

---

## **Flashcard 13**
**Q:** What is the delivery pattern of Agile?  
**A:** Short iterations called **sprints**.

---

## **Flashcard 14**
**Q:** What is the flexibility level of the Predictive life cycle?  
**A:** **Low** flexibility.

---

## **Flashcard 15**
