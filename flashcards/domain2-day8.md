# CAPM Domain II Flashcards – Day 8 (Predictive Practice Targets)

## Requirements & Traceability

**1. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**  
*Front*: What is the purpose of the **requirements traceability matrix**?  
*Back*: To **track each requirement** from origin through implementation and testing, ensuring it is addressed in **scope, WBS, deliverables, and acceptance tests** [web:141].

**2. Collect Requirements vs Define Scope**  
*Front*: How do **Collect Requirements** and **Define Scope** differ?  
*Back*: Collect Requirements = **document stakeholder needs**; Define Scope = turn those needs into the **project scope statement**, which later becomes part of the **scope baseline** [web:141].

## WBS & Scope Baseline

**3. Create WBS – Output**  
*Front*: What are the key outputs of **Create WBS**?  
*Back*: The **WBS**, **WBS dictionary**, and updates that help form the **scope baseline** [web:139].

**4. WBS Main Purpose**  
*Front*: What is the primary purpose of the **WBS**?  
*Back*: To **decompose total project work into manageable work packages**.

**5. Scope Baseline Composition & Processes**  
*Front*: Which components and processes create the **scope baseline**?  
*Back*: Components: **scope statement, WBS, WBS dictionary**.  
Processes: **Define Scope** (creates scope statement) and **Create WBS** (creates WBS and WBS dictionary) [web:141][web:139].

**6. Activity List / Define Activities**  
*Front*: Which process breaks work packages into specific actions that can be estimated and scheduled, producing the **activity list**?  
*Back*: **Define Activities** – decomposes work packages into **activities** and outputs the activity list and attributes [web:141].

## Schedule & Critical Path

**7. Sequence Activities**  
*Front*: What happens in **Sequence Activities**?  
*Back*: Activities are **ordered and linked** with logical relationships (FS, SS, FF, SF) to build **network diagrams**.

**8. Critical Path Use**  
*Front*: Why is the **critical path** important?  
*Back*: It shows the **longest path with zero total float**, indicating the **shortest possible project duration**; delay here usually delays the project [web:141].

**9. Schedule Baseline Creation**  
*Front*: During which process is the **schedule baseline** first created?  
*Back*: During **Develop Schedule**, once the schedule has been analyzed and approved, it becomes the **schedule baseline** [web:155].

## Cost Estimates & Baseline

**10. Estimate Costs**  
*Front*: What is produced in **Estimate Costs**?  
*Back*: **Cost estimates** and **basis of estimates** for activities or work packages.

**11. Determine Budget**  
*Front*: Which process establishes the **project budget and cost baseline**?  
*Back*: **Determine Budget**, which aggregates cost estimates and funding requirements into the **cost baseline** [web:141][web:155].

**12. Cost Baseline**  
*Front*: What is the **cost baseline**?  
*Back*: The **time‑phased, approved budget** used to track cost performance.

---

## Estimating Techniques

**13. Analogous Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **analogous (top‑down) estimating**?  
*Back*: Using **historical data from similar projects** to quickly estimate costs or durations at a high level.

**14. Parametric Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **parametric estimating**?  
*Back*: Using **unit rates** (e.g., per kilometer, per story, per feature) multiplied by quantities to estimate cost or duration.

**15. Bottom-Up Estimating**  
*Front*: What is **bottom‑up estimating**?  
*Back*: Estimating detailed components (activities/work packages) and **summing them** to get overall estimates.

## Change Control & Exam Cues

**16. Formal Change Control Trigger**  
*Front*: When is **formal change control** required in predictive projects?  
*Back*: When a change **affects approved scope, schedule, or cost baselines** [web:141].

**17. Change Request First Step**  
*Front*: What should the PM do FIRST when a change request may impact baselines?  
*Back*: **Analyze the impact** on scope, schedule, and cost, then submit it through **formal change control**.

**18. Predictive Exam Cue – Stable, Regulated**  
*Front*: On the exam, what do “**stable regulatory requirements**” and “**fixed price contract**” usually signal?  
*Back*: Use a **predictive / plan-based approach** with strong baselines.

**19. RTM on Exam**  
*Front*: In an exam scenario asking how to ensure all requirements are delivered and tested, which artifact should you think of?  
*Back*: The **requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**.

**20. Integration Document**  
*Front*: Which document integrates scope, schedule, and cost planning and control?  
*Back*: The **project management plan**, which houses subsidiary plans and baselines [web:141][web:155].
